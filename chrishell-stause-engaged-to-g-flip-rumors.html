Back in May 2022, the reality star revealed that <a href=#>she's seeing non-binary singer, G Flip</a> during <a href=#>season 5's bombshell reunion episode</a>. Later, a source also told People that <a href=#>the couple has moved in together</a>. Here's the real status of their relationship these days.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Selling Sunset Star Emma Hernan Is Constantly Risking Her Life And Causing Fans To Panic</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-chrishell-stause-and-g-flip-meet>How Did Chrishell Stause and G Flip Meet?</h2><p>Two months before the reunion episode, Stause shared a photo of her and G Flip together on Instagram. It was placed casually in the middle of a carousel post. "Round up from most pics that went in stories. ðð» Hope you guys have an amazing weekend! Grateful for every person in these pics! Curious- do you guys enjoy pics or vids better..? ð¤" said the caption. A few days later, an insider told Us Weekly that the pair attended an Oscars after-party together. "They both were by themselves at a table and didn't interact much with others," the source shared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the reunion, Stause said that she first met the Australian native when she starred in their music video. "I recently have been spending a lot of time with someone that's very important to me, their name is G Flip. They're non-binary so they go by they/them," she confessed, <a href=#>leaving the cast surprised</a>. "And they are an extremely talented musician. And it started because, you know, I was just going to be in their video. It's about this chaotic love story. And, you know, I come from soaps, I love acting, and with the job that we have I don't always get to do it. And so, at first of course I was like 'yes, let's do that.'"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Christine Quinn Was Disinvited From The MTV Awards</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-chrishell-stause-amp-g-flip-engaged>Are Chrishell Stause & G Flip Engaged?</h2><p>On July 17, Stause posted a series of photos and videos from her surprise birthday party. There, she was spotted wearing a sparkler on her left hand. "I have the BEST friends," the realtor captioned the carousel post. "So my actual bday is Thursday July 21st, & thought I was just going to dinner with @emmahernan. Bday elves Emma & @jasonoppenheim coordinated the absolute BEST early bday surprise!" Shortly after the speculations, they were slammed by a representative for the Days of Our Lives alum.</p><p>"They are in fact not engaged," said the rep of the couple in a statement for Us Weekly. They added that the ring was "just a ring and nothing else," much like the birthday girl's bejeweled crown. G Flip was also absent from the party. But they greeted the celebrant in the comments, saying, "Happy early bday darling â¤ï¸." Stause replied saying they were "soooo missed! ð."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On June 28, 2022, the Gay 4 Me singer posted photos and clips of her featuring her injured hand. They didn't disclose what happened but opened up about going against their doctor's advice of taking four weeks off. The show must go on for the drummer who even shared videos of them playing the drums with one hand in front of a huge crowd. Stause expressed her support in the comments, writing: "You can't be stopped!! Gonna have 2 dominate hands after this. Watch outð¥ðð¥ð."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Maya Vander Won't Be Returning To Selling Sunset</a></span></p><h2 id=do-chrishell-stause-amp-g-flip-plan-on-having-kids>Do Chrishell Stause & G Flip Plan On Having Kids?</h2><p>Back in May, G Flip said that they could "definitely" see kids in their future. "I definitely see children in my future," said the Drink Too Much hitmaker on the PEOPLE Every Day podcast. "Right now, me and Chrishell know where we are in the stages of our lives. And we're very transparent about that. I love children. I was a music teacher for years before I became a session drummer and then a solo artist, so I was like, I've always loved kids and yeah, definitely one day that'll be in the future."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They also feel that having children "changes the world and it normalizes same-sex relationships and family structures." Stause previously said in the reunion that she's open to adoption. "Two people who have the same sex organs can still have children," G flip continued, adding that she's grateful for Stause's existence. "I'm very fortunate to have her in my life. We both feel like we'll be in each other's life forever. We have like a very strong connection that you don't find every day."
