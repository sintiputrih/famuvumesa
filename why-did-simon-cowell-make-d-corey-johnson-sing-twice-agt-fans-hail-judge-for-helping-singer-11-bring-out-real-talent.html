D'Corey got the audience up and dancing with his rendition of Journey's 'Open Arms', but it wasn't until Simon Cowell requested him to sing a section of a song again that his true skill was shown.</p><p>D'Corey is a resident of Louisville, Kentucky. He is still a student at James H Bates Elementary School. His performance of the national anthem on the morning announcements while he was in third grade went viral on social media. D'Corey began singing when he was approximately three years old. D'Corey has already had several film credits in his 11 years. He appeared as a featured vocalist in the films 'Sing 2' and 'The Loud House Movie'!</p><h2 class=split>'Very happy also that Simon took the music away'</h2><p>D'Corey, dressed to the nines in a gray suit coat and bright green bow tie, delivered a crowd-pleasing rendition of Journey's 'Open Arms,' but it wasn't until Judge Simon asked him to sing the ballad again without the backing track that his true natural talent shone through, earning him a 'yes' vote from all four judges.</p><p>"When he took the track away, less is more. You’re a better singer than even what you performed today. You are so much better," Judge Howie Mandel said of the acapella version available on demand. "I love what you did."</p><p>The judges' appreciation, along with the audience's standing ovation, brought the aspiring singer to tears. "To be here, I'm just so happy," he exclaimed.</p><p>Before launching into the song, the Louisville, Kentucky native told the judges about his great Broadway goals. "I want to be on Broadway and be in movies and I want to be in Hamilton and Wicked," he stated. His journey to America's theater capital, however, would be incomplete without a stop at 'AGT' along the way to test his vocal talents and maybe gain the affection of the notoriously difficult-to-please Judge Simon. "I watch AGT almost every day," D'Corey said to the Judges. "Simon, you are my favorite because you keep it real, like my mama."</p><p>"Somebody likes me. Thank you so much," Simon said, laughing.</p><p>While D'Corey was gathering his nerve to begin, Simon could be heard encouraging the 11-year-old. "Be good, be good, be good," he told himself.</p><p>D'Corey's version of 'Open Arms' had the audience on its feet with Johnson hitting some high notes, but Simon thought there was something lacking. He then realized that the tween's "timing was off."</p><p>"Do you mind if I ask you to sing up to the chorus without the backing track?" Simon inquired. D'Corey agreed, pausing just briefly before breaking into a passionate acapella rendition of the power ballad that captivated all four judges.</p><p>"Bravo," exclaimed Judge Sofa Vergara. "I thought that that was amazing, D'Corey. I think that you definitely have a place on Broadway." Judge Heidi Klum expressed optimism that his "wish will come true" in the coming years. "I’m very happy also that Simon took the music away because the music was just in the way," she remarked. "I have a good feeling about you." Simon praised Johnson for his distinct voice. "I think you know the kind of singer you want to be, where you want to end up, which is really important," he remarked. "I think you have such a distinctive, great voice." He anticipated that D'Corey's talent will only grow "better and better" with time. "It’s so difficult to say what will happen in the future. What I can say? I promise you, things are just going to be amazing, really," Simon remarked. "I'd love to be the first person to say yes."</p><p>D'Corey was astonished when the rest of the judges immediately followed suit. "Thank you so much," he remarked as the audience applauded him.</p><p>When D'Corey returned backstage, host Terry Crews checked up with him and inquired what he was thinking following his great audition. "I’m overwhelmed because I always wanted to be on this show, and I’m glad that I got to be," an emotional D'Corey said before receiving a heartfelt embrace from his mother.</p><h2 class=split>'The kid without the music was best'</h2><p>On Twitter, fans hailed Simon as they write, "So cute I'm glad Simon had him redo it the softness was not enough. The higher sound was much better." Another chimed in, "You know what’s up when 3 seconds in producer Simon kicks in, pauses and gets that look in his eyes." Fans happy to hear him the second time, wrote, "The kid without the music was best, nd he emotionally transmitted to us the joy of his voice, he even cried at the end, he probably got nervous nd emotional, but it was the best part of his performance ….. nice !! @SofiaVergara Nice to see u again mami, me hiciste la noche." A fourth user tweeted, "D’Corey was REALLY GOOD!! Thought he was going to get the golden buzzer tonight."</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>So cute I'm glad Simon had him redo it the softness was not enough.

Another added, "This young man was better without the track. Fantabulous." One person also commented, "The track was drowning him out. Don’t usually agree with @simoncowell but his voice is perfect without a track!!." A fourth user wrote, "Excellent.
