His fourth “proper” album (depending on how you count these things) hit iTunes and Apple Music — where it will remain an exclusive for a limited time — just before midnight on Thursday, complete with <a href=#>an in-depth interview on Zane Lowe’s Beats 1 Radio</a>. But like anything Drake does these days, <i>Views</i> isn’t just an album — it’s a megameme event. To catch you up to speed on all the latest controversies, possible Meek Mill disses, and failed attempts at romancing Rihanna, we broke down all 20 (!) <i>Views </i>songs, below.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-183a3b96242ed307b2ae3873baa9984d-3-0-0@published data-word-count=4><strong>“Keep the Family Close”</strong><span><br></span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-183a3b96242ed307b2ae3873baa9984d-4-0-0@published data-word-count=176><span>In </span><a href=#><span>Drake’s interview with Lowe</span></a><span>, he described </span><a href=#><i>Views</i></a><span> as a passing of the seasons in Toronto, from winter through summer and back again. </span><span>“It’s a little chilly out there,” an unidentified woman says, introducing what’s about to be a long lamentation on severed relationships. “And it’s all because you chose a side / You’re supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me / Guess it wasn’t time / And of course you went and chose a side that wasn’t mine,” he sings on the song’s bridge, over a full-on orchestra. (Drama King, that Drake.) Is he talking about </span><a href=#><span>Nicki Minaj and Meek Mill</span></a><span>, </span><a href=#><span>Lil Wayne vs. Birdman</span></a><span>, XYZ woman, or all of the above? As usual, Drake’s tea is served at room temperature, so, like him, we don’t know what’s going on, either. It closes with yet another unidentified woman (a theme for Drake) bragging about not being afraid of “no gyal or man,” “no </span><a href=#><span>cyattie</span></a><span>,” or “no </span><a href=#><span>waste yute</span></a><span>” — so be prepared for Drake to lay the Caribbean maybe-appropriation on thick soon.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-183a3b96242ed307b2ae3873baa9984d-5-0-0@published data-word-count=1><strong>“9”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-183a3b96242ed307b2ae3873baa9984d-6-0-0@published data-word-count=73><span>Ah yes, the first of many self-aggrandizing victory laps to come. Here, we get Drake claiming to be “MJ in every way” and having “turned the 6 upside down, it’s a 9 now,” in reference to the mark he’s left on what was once the album’s sort-of titular city. It samples dancehall legends Mavado and Serani’s “</span><a href=#><span>Dying</span></a><span>.” (Hey, remember when Mavado had Drake killed in the “</span><a href=#><span>Find Your Love</span></a><span>” video?

And yes, that voice you hear at the beginning asking, “What these bitches want from a nigga?” is DMX, from a sample of “</span><a href=#><span>What These Bitches Want?</span></a><span>” The rest of the song samples DMX’s “</span><a href=#><span>How’s It Goin Down</span></a><span>,” an unexpected choice considering DMX’s previous </span><a href=#><span>harsh words</span></a><span> for Drake. (Though apparently we can</span><a href=#><span> thank N.O.R.E.</span></a><span> for squashing the beef long enough to clear the sample.) The song goes on to detail exactly why playing late-night mind games with Drake will almost always backfire. “You toyin’ with it like Happy Meal,” Drake raps. </span><span>Major </span><span>third-degree burn.

Over a sample of the sublime Mary J. Blige deep-cut “</span><a href=#><span>Mary’s Joint</span></a><span>,” Drake gets introspective about the street on which he grew up (referencing his “momma” again), how fast life has come at him since then, and when he’ll hang it up (“The most successful rapper 35 and under … That’s when I plan to retire”). But leave it to our greatest-living meme to reference another meme, even on a track that aims to get deep: “I’m lookin’ at they first week numbers like </span><a href=#><span>what are thoooose?</span></a><span>”</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-183a3b96242ed307b2ae3873baa9984d-15-0-0@published data-word-count=1><strong>“Redemption”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-183a3b96242ed307b2ae3873baa9984d-16-0-0@published data-word-count=88><span>What’s a Drake album without an “I used to know you when” petty party in which Drake gets ultra possessive about women who have since moved on? Such a thing does not exist, and so here we have Drake spilling his male tears with lines like “I miss the feeling of you missing me,” once again name-checking his exes — including the</span><a href=#><span> infamous Erica from “Marvin’s Room”</span></a><span> — and wondering if they still listen to his music and think about him.
