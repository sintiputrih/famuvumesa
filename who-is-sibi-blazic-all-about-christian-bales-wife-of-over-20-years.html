From American Psycho to The Dark Knight, Bale’s career is only growing larger by the second, as the actor reaches three decades on Hollywood grounds as one of the most coveted actors of all time. Just recently, the Welsh actor took part in one of the most anticipated films on Netflix’s The Pale Blue Eye, where the actor played Augustus Landor in the Edgar Allen Poe biopic.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=656 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>This immense fame and unmatched résumé results in the globalization of Bale’s popularity all over the world as one of the greatest actors of all time. Contrary to the popular belief that celebrities — who are often in the public eye — have no privacy at all, Bale is an exception to the rule. The 49-year-old has stuck to his British roots, and remained relatively protective of his privacy, keeping a low profile when it comes to any personal endeavors. Despite this wish for privacy, the actor never hid or ran from walking hand in hand with his wife, Sibi Blažić. Here is everything you must know about Bale’s wife of over 20 years.</p><h2 id=h-everything-to-know-about-sibi-blazic data-injectable=false>Everything to know about Sibi Blažić</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Christian Bale Fans (@christianbale.fans)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=800 data-injectable=true>Blažić and Bale’s marriage dates back to the year 2000, when the couple eloped in Las Vegas. For years to come, they would become known for being one of Hollywood’s most low-key couples, despite sharing two children together, while Bale often gloats about his wife and children in interviews. What many may not know, however, is that although Blažić is not necessarily on the same entertainment path as her beau, she was still a constant presence on Hollywood grounds for many years.</p><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>The Chicago-born Jill-of-all-trades has gone through being a personal assistant, to model, to makeup artist, and even a stunt driver. Blažić’s career is actually what led to her relationship with Bale, which derives from her past job as Winona Ryder’s personal assistant. While on the set of the 1994 film Little Women, which starred Bale and Ryder, the couple met through their common dominator, where their relationship began blooming behind the scenes.</p><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>Her connection to the acting world does not end there. In addition to being a personal assistant for years, Blažić was also a model and makeup artist for a long while. Although modeling may not come to mind when someone hears her name, her former days as a model were materialized by her feature in the late makeup artist Kevyn Aucoin’s New York Times best-selling book, Face Forward. That same book also featured Celine Dion and Julianne Moore.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FTfONiuWYAs3bpq.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FTfONivXoAA5-KE.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FTfONivXoAEWrAx.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FTfONioWAAAJvpg.jpg><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>The former model was, surprisingly, also a stunt driver. The only time the duo seemed to share a camera on set was during Bale’s Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises. During a particularly intense car chase, one of the police vehicles chasing Bale (or Bruce Wayne) across New York was driven by Blažić, who according to the actor “can do 180s and stunts.” In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, Bale shared that this versatility from his wife absolutely “terrified [him].”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Christian Bale did not believe in marriage before meeting Sibi Blažić</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Christian Bale Fans (@christianbale.fans)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=531 data-current-count=831 data-injectable=true>It only makes sense for someone anything but ordinary to be in a lifetime commitment with someone who shares the same level of excitement with him. Although her fruitful career and past are certainly worthy of praise, the former model achieved yet another milestone no one could previously attain: she snagged the heart of one of Hollywood’s best actors. Even when the actor himself did not believe in a healthy idea of marriage, as he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Easy Living</a> magazine, citing his parents’ divorce as the source of this ideal.</p><p>“I never planned to marry. Everyone was divorced in my family so I didn’t have very healthy ideas about marriage. Then I met Sibi and suddenly it seemed a fantastic idea.”</p><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=729 data-injectable=true>The Welsh actor not only credits his wife for his shift of ideals, but also for a large portion of his career’s success. According to the actor via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parade</a>, Bale credited Blažić for helping him improve his acting skills on set. “My wife and daughter come with me on location. It’s the most ideal mix,” he said, “These wonderful distractions actually make me better at what I do.” Bale has also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">thanked his wife on nearly every award show</a>, where he always celebrated his success alongside his family.</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=185 data-injectable=false>To find Blažić and Bale’s exciting car chase, The Dark Knight Rises can be found and streamed on HBO Max. Bale’s latest project The Pale Blue Eye is available on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmq5mXtm6uy5qxoptdlrmtecCbpq6sXZi1s7XSraCapl2Xrq2x0mauop6VYrynec6vnKtlYmV6urHAq6po</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alec-gores-net-worth-50038.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alec Gores Net Worth">&larr;
