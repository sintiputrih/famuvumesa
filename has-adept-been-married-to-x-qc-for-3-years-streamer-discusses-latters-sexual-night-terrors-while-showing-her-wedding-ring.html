Adept recently revealed their relationship, claiming they have been married for three years. During one of her live streams, Adept even showed her call history and said that she had been "trying to tell the truth" for a while.</p><p>Along with claiming her ring as the "wedding ring" from xQc, Adept also tried to debunk xQc's claims regarding "sexual night terrors." Fans of the two Twitch streamers are now divided on who's telling the truth, even though Adept reiterated that all her claims should be taken as "truthful statements."</p><h2 class=split>‘Sexual night terrors’</h2><p>Adept addressed xQc's "sexual night terrors" throughout the opening few minutes of her live stream and asserted that the diagnosis is unfounded. She began saying, “What I'm going to say is for educational purposes only! Purely (for) educational purposes. Sexual night terrors are not a real f**king thing. And I say this as educational purposes because it is very important to protect yourselves from anyone in your life, who would ever tell you... that they are suffering from sexual night terrors. They are not a real thing.” The Twitch streamer continued by saying she "would love to see" her community demonstrate the veracity of the diagnosis.</p><h2 class=split>‘This is my wedding ring’</h2><p>Soon, she started talking about her marriage to xQc while avoiding using his name, perhaps because of the continuing legal dispute. Declaring her desire to speak the truth, Adept said, "I've spent a lot of time trying to be honest." She then revealed her ring to the camera and added, “This is my wedding ring. This wedding ring was purchased on May 8, wasn’t that the day of the receipt? And I didn’t buy it, and that’s a truthful statement. I’ve been married for three years, that’s a truthful statement.”</p><p>She even showed a lengthy call history from unknown callers, hinting that everything was produced by xQc on May 15. On that day, xQc abruptly and mysteriously halted his stream. After connecting the dots, it appears that Adept was involved in that incident. Fans have been wanting to know xQc and Adept's relationship status for a long time now. They began to speculate that the couple might have been married when their divorce filing leaked earlier this year. xQc, however, has since denied rumors of being married to his former girlfriend, Adept.</p><p>This article contains remarks made on the internet by individual people and organizations.
