He began his career as a quarterback at Westlake High School and subsequently went on to play quarterback at Purdue University, where he led the Boilermakers to the Big Ten Championship and a Rose Bowl berth.</strong></p><p>Brees was chosen by the San Diego Chargers in 2001 and appeared in his first Pro Bowl with the team in 2004. Later, in 2006, he joined the New Orleans Saints, where he guided the club to Super Bowl XLIV triumph in 2009. Brees holds several NFL records for throwing yards, completions, and touchdowns.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Drew_Brees_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Drew Brees? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Drew Brees is one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history. During his 19-year career, he has established various records and earned hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>In March 2020, he agreed to terms with the New Orleans Saints on a two-year, $50 million contract that included a $23 million signing bonus.

He is the eldest son of trial lawyer Eugene Wilson “Chip” Brees II and lawyer Mina Ruth (née Akins). Reid Brees is his younger sibling.</p><p>Drew hails from an athletic family. His father played basketball at Texas A&M, and his mother was an all-state player in three high school sports.</p><p>His maternal grandpa, Ray Akins, is regarded as one of the top high school football coaches in Texas history, and his uncle, Marty Akins, was an All-Southwest Conference quarterback in 1975. Reid, his friend, was a Baylor Bears outfielder. His grandpa also took part in the Battle of Okinawa.</p><p>His parents divorced and divided custody of the children when he was seven years old.

During his high school years, he excelled in basketball, baseball, and football.

They are the parents of four children: three males, Baylen, Bowen, and Callen, born in January 2009, October 2010, and August 2012, respectively, and one daughter, Rylen, born in August 2014.</p><p>He lives in Uptown New Orleans with his family. They migrated there following Hurricane Katrina’s devastation. Following the storm, Drew made substantial contributions to the New Orleans community.</p><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Drew_Brees_Weight_Hair_Color>How tall is Drew Brees? Weight, Hair Color</span></h2><p>Drew is 41 years old and was born on January 15, therefore his zodiac sign is Capricorn. He stands 6 feet 0 inches (183 cm) tall and weighs 209 pounds (95 kg). He follows a stringent food regimen to preserve his health and fitness level so that he may continue to play football.</p><p>Drew’s dietary allergies require him to follow a gluten-free, dairy-free, and nut-free diet. His black hair and brown eyes stand out against his flawless skin and strong frame.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Drew_Brees_start_his_Professional_Career>How did Drew Brees start his Professional Career?</span></h2><p>Initially, he planned to play collegiate baseball, but after blowing out his knee, his plans altered. As a sophomore in 1995, he moved to quarterback. He wasn’t your typical quarterback, though; he was shorter and considerably thinner than other quarterbacks. His arm, on the other hand, was the hero; every time he threw, it soared straight, genuine, and powerful.</p><p>During his junior year, he was voted the Most Valuable Offensive Player. His high school football team was undefeated and won the state title. Drew completed 314 of 490 passes (64.1 percent) for 5461 yards and 50 touchdowns. He was on the state high school football all-star squad as well as the All-USA high school football formation.</p><p><strong>College Football</strong></p><p>Drew was a standout as a junior. During his junior and senior years, he was a vital player of Joe Tiller and Jim Chaney’s unusual “basketball on grass” spread offense, serving as offensive captain. Brees was given a slot in the 2000 NFL Draft during his junior year, but elected to finish his studies instead.</p><p>During his undergraduate career, Drew set two NCAA records, 13 Big Ten Conference records, and 19 Purdue University records. With 11792 throwing yards, 90 touchdown passes, 12,693 total offensive yards, 1026 completions, and 1678 attempts, he established multiple records. In 2009, he was inducted into Purdue’s Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Smolsprout, Martin Braithwaite, and Victoria Mercado."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4480,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial"}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":21}{"1":23,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":41}{"1":47,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":63}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/smolsprout/"}{"1":21}{"1":23,"2":"https://popularbio.com/martin-braithwaite/"}{"1":41}{"1":47,"2":"https://popularbio.com/victoria-mercado/"}{"1":63}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Smolsprout</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Martin Braithwaite</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Victoria Mercado</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Football Player</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Ryan Poles | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></h3>Ryan Poles is a prominent executive in the American Football industry in addition to being a football participant, fan, and supporter.
