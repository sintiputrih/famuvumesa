American SmartGurlz Inc.</p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Who is the Founder of SmartGurlz?</span></strong></h2><p>Sharmi Albrechtsen is the creator of SmartGurlz, a line of self-balancing robots and action dolls designed to inspire girls to learn to code. In November 2017, she pitched her STEM business on Shark Tank.</p><p>Albrechtsen entered the Tank looking for $200,000 in exchange for 5% equity. She struck a deal with Daymond John: $200,000 for a 25% stake. (Initially, he offered $200k for 30% with a licensing direction.)</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Naomi Judd Net Worth 2022: What Was Her Net Worth At The Time Of Her Death?</a></li><li><a href=#>Amal Clooney Net Worth 2022: How Rich Is Lawyer & Court Clerk, Book Editor Amal Clooney?</a></li><li><a href=#>Corey Gamble Net Worth And Earning In 2022 And What Does Corey Gamble Do For Money?</a></li><li><a href=#>Roger Goodell Net Worth 2022: Income & Salary History, Early Life, Career, And More Details!</a></li></ul><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>What Happened to SmartGurlz at the Shark Tank Pitch?</span></strong></h2><p><strong>BUSINESS PITCH –</strong> fun and easy way for girls to learn how to code with dolls<br><strong>ENTREPRENEUR/FOUNDER –</strong> Sharmi Albrechtsen<br><strong>ASKED FOR –</strong> $200,000 for 5%<br><strong>DEAL –</strong> $200,000 for 25%<br><strong>SHARK –</strong> Daymond John</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/smart-gurlz-in-shark-tank.jpg><p>Sharmi made an appearance on Shark Tank season 9 episode 10 with two young girls seeking $200,000 in exchange for a 5% stake. This equals a $4 million valuation. She gives her pitch, tells her story, and displays her toys.<br>After her presentation, she brings the Sharks on stage to test them out.</p><p>Richard is the first to leave, and to his surprise, he is given a doll of himself. Sharmi, in fact, has dolls of all of the Sharks.</p><p>The two young ladies begin teaching Richard how to code after the Sharks have taken their places.</p><p>She revealed that the company has only been in business for less than six months, and she informs the sharks that they have already made $250,000 in sales.</p><p>Robert then inquires about the $250,000 in sales, which Sharmi explains was generated by a combination of wholesalers, stores, and Amazon.<br>When asked where the items are now available, she says they can be purchased on their website for $79.99.</p><p>When the sharks inquire about production costs, she responds that each item costs $18 to produce.</p><p>Daymond is enamored with it, but he makes a Sharky offer of $200,000 for 30% of the company. He wants to sell the toys on his own.</p><p>Because Robert believes that the toy industry is difficult, he is leaving.</p><p>Lori believes Daymond’s offer is the best one, and she is departing.</p><p>Richard is impressed by her efforts, but he tells her that he doesn’t believe he can contribute to the project and thus withdraws as well.</p><p>Finally, the focus shifts to Mark, the last shark standing. To her chagrin, he also backs out.</p><p>In response to Daymond’s offer, Sharmi asks if he will consider lowering it to $200,000 for a 20% stake, to which he says no.</p><p>Trying her luck again, she makes another counteroffer—$200,000 for 25%. Finally, the shark agrees that the effort was worthwhile.</p><p>He walks up to her and quickly embraces her after completing the transaction.</p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>What Happened to SmartGurlz after the Shark Tank Pitch?</span></strong></h2><p>This company’s sales skyrocketed after the show aired, as they always do. Sharmi was unfazed by the fact that the transaction with Daymond never materialized.</p><p>In 2018, sales amounted to $1.2 million. She raised an additional $525,000 in 2019 through WeFunder.</p><p>SmartGurlz also announced a Letter of Intent (LOI) with Walmart to launch a new product line in the fall of 2019.</p><p>SmartGurlz was also named the IEEE Women in Engineering Leadership Conference’s Best Start-up.</p><p>In 2019, she also collaborated with Pitsco Education to develop Smart Buddies, an online coding curriculum for third through fifth-grade students.<br>Pitsco provides courses to schools across the United States. Pitsco was required to acquire $5.5 million in merchandise over a three-year period under the terms of the agreement.</p><p>Because of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, they made the curriculum available online, which will remain after the epidemic has passed.</p><p>The company is still doing well as of June 2021, and Sharmi expects to end the year with more than $20 million in revenue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX6i6or7TZp6uqpyveq%2Bx02auqKqknXx3fphxZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./corsair-at-ces-2014-the-mx-rgb-project.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Mechanical Keyboard with Per-Key Full RGB, aka the MX RGB Project">&larr;
