As Peter Vale, a historian at the University of Pretoria, wrote in <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">a recent essay for the Conversation</a>, where he described Kissinger’s record in Africa as “dismal” and said he “neither ended colonialism nor minority rule in the region”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>He wrote: “Kissinger’s interest in southern Africa in the mid-1970s was predicated on the idea that balance would return if the interests of the strong were restored. He failed to understand that the struggle for justice was changing the world – and diplomacy itself.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Speaking to the Guardian, Vale described the meeting at the Hotel Bodenmais and what it portended. “The conference was a bunch of white men sitting in Germany. He saw Africa in terms of Europe and as a subtext of European diplomacy.”</p><figure id=8d5871c4-6daf-4de3-986d-8ccb968584bb data-spacefinder-role=supporting data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-a2pvoh><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>With Zambia’s president, Kenneth Kaunda, in Lusaka, Zambia, in September 1976.</span> Photograph: Zuma Press/Alamy</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>That was perhaps nowhere more obvious than in his visit to South Africa, where <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">he persuaded a tearful Ian Smith</a> – in town for a rugby match – to agree to majority rule. As Vale points out, he met only one black South African figure who was critical of apartheid. His visit, he says, was the “high point of apartheid’s diplomacy”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“What were the harms?” Vale asks. He suggests the visit to South Africa “probably extended the life of the apartheid regime” while contributing to a significant military mobilisation around Angola, which South African forces would invade again in 1987, leading to the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">battle and siege of Cuito Cuanavale</a>.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Nancy Mitchell agrees. “I think it is very plausible [that Kissinger’s diplomacy in Africa] gave apartheid more years,” she says.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“Since it was felt that Mozambique was also going, the idea was to have a white buffer. It was felt important for white South Africa to stay stable because of trade and minerals. Much of it was a deliberate attempt to buttress South Africa.”</p><figure id=cb232d86-f773-417e-b921-f128000a77b2 data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement class=dcr-1your1i><a href=# class=dcr-1m887w9>‘My activism started then’: the Soweto uprising rememberedRead more</a></figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Perhaps the last word should be left for the late Donald Easum, whose memorandums – and those of many other seasoned colleagues in the state department Africa bureau – Kissinger ignored.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“It is impossible to know what might have resulted had Kissinger accepted the policy stances toward Angola of the first two Africa bureau assistant secretaries he hired.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“It is in any case difficult to imagine that their recommendations would have resulted in the kind of nightmare – for Angolans, for US prestige, and for himself – that his bludgeoning of the bureaucracy provoked.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>As Easum notes sadly, it would take “until 2002 for peace to come to that war-racked, landmine-strewn nation”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJ%2BcpK%2BiuIydnK%2BdnKS9rrHNrWZraGJofK6t2GhpbmeYmruzxYykoKyrmaO0pr6MamdpZaOpv6LAxKCgnGWXmruqwdJmpqtllJa6orPIp55mnJmlubC5wJywZqCVobFursCcomaZlqe2pK0%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./queen-camilla-son-tom-parker-bowles-modern-home-photo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Queen Camilla's son Tom Parker Bowles' home is so unexpected">&larr;
