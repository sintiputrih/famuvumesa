They are specifically popular in darker shades including black, purples, greens, and blues. Our team has formulated this guide to provide you with all the information you need to know regarding these nail polishes.</p><h3>What Are the Two Different Types of Matte Nail Polishes?</h3><p>The two main types of matte nail polishes include a mattifying top coat and a pigmented matte nail polish. We have mentioned the pros and cons of each below.</p><h4>Mattifying top coat</h4><p>A mattifying top coat is a clear nail polish that can be applied over any regular polish to give it a matte finish. It works by disturbing the flat surface of regular nail polish and giving it a texture that makes your nails appear completely matte. Most matte top coats contain silica gel, which works by making the texture of your nails uneven. The advantage of using a top coat is that you can switch between the regular, shiny look or the matte look, depending on your mood. However, some people find it difficult to achieve the perfect matte look with a top coat.</p><h4>Pigmented matte nail polish</h4><p>Pigmented matte nail polishes are matte to begin with. When you apply them to your nails, they will become completely matte once they are dry. This is convenient as you do not have to go through the extra effort of having to apply two coats of regular nail polish and then applying a mattifying top coat. However, with a matte nail polish, you do not have the freedom to play around with different colors and make any regular nail polish matte.</p><h3>How to Choose the Right Matte Nail Polish</h3><p>With the tons of options available online, it is easy to get confused between several brands. Almost all brands provide a lot of color options as well. To make your decision easier, consider the following factors.</p><h4>Fast-drying</h4><p>One of the properties of good quality matte nail polishes is that they dry quickly. This is especially beneficial if you use a pigmented matte nail polish instead of a top coat. So, before purchasing one, try to evaluate the time it takes to dry. You can do this by reading the reviews of customers who have purchased and used the nail polish personally. Choose lacquers that have a quick-drying formula.</p><h4>Ingredients</h4><p>With any cosmetic product, be it makeup or nail polish, it is absolutely essential to go through the ingredients list before purchasing. This is because some of them can contain harsh chemicals like parabens, formaldehyde, and phthalates, which can be harmful to you in the long run. You can even find vegan options these days, and we recommend that you give preference to cruelty-free brands. Moreover, if you are pregnant, make sure you buy a pregnancy-safe matte nail polish.</p><h4>Long-lasting</h4><p>One of the major properties that people look for in nail polishes is how long they will stay. If you are tired of your nail polish chipping a day after applying it, you need to switch to matte nail polishes which last longer. You can opt for smudge-proof and chip-resistant matte nail polishes as these can even last for about 2 weeks.</p><h3>How to Choose the Color of Matte Nail Polishes</h3><p>Probably the most confusing choice is picking a color from the array of options available. Generally, matte nail polishes are more popular in darker shades like burgundy, dark blue, gray, black, and midnight green. These are ideal for a night look, and for colder seasons including fall and winter. You can opt for lighter colors including pastels for the spring or summer season. However, it is important to remember that you cannot just pick colors randomly. Everyone has a different skin tone, and what looks good on one hand will not necessarily look good on every hand.</p><p>If you buy physically from a store, you can always apply testers and get an idea of how the nail color will look on your skin tone. The problem arises when you are buying online. You can follow a few general tips to choose a color that will suit your skin tone. Pastels and solid colors will look good on lighter skin as they will be more prominent. People with a medium skin tone are the luckiest as most shades look good on them. They can opt for coral colors or stick to ones like sky blue. For people with dark skin, the best option is to stick to intense, deep colors as they will complement their skin color perfectly.</p><h3>How to Remove Matte Nail Polish</h3><p>Removing matte nail polish is no different than removing regular nail polish. All you need are cotton pads and a nail polish remover to completely get rid of it. If you do not have a remover, you can make use of items like vinegar, lemon juice, and hydrogen peroxide to remove your matte nail polish. However, one problem that a lot of people face is that some matte nail polishes tend to stain your nails. The only remedy to this problem is to apply a base coat before applying your matte nail polish. Some people believe that applying a base coat will prevent your nails from becoming completely matte, but this is not the case.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwr86spJ6smZjAcLnAraueZZ6Wtq15z6ijoquYZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./18-truly-hard-seltzer-nutrition-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="18 Truly Hard Seltzer Nutrition Facts">&larr;
