Who can forget the song he wrote for his wife Chrissy Teigen called “All of Me“? The lyrics are so romantic and meaningful… That was one of the most popular songs to be played in weddings for several years after its release in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blake-shelton-80-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Blake Shelton: $80 Million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Shelton.jpeg><p class=p1><a href=#>Blake Shelton</a> has a net worth of $80 million and has been a judge on&nbsp;The Voice since the very first season. Allegedly, he receives $13 million per season which has definitely added to the overall load of his net worth! Another source of his income comes from his country music career.

After season 16, Adam Levine decided to part ways with the show but he was a huge staple up until that point. He has released a lot of amazing songs over the years and has even taken home three Grammys. Honestly, a lot of his friends believe he should have taken home Waymore Grammys and that since he has been nominated 10 times. His Grammy awards come from his time being the lead singer of Maroon 5.</p><h2 id=gwen-stefani-150-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Gwen Stefani: $150 Million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Gwen-Stefani-1.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1>Another beloved judge from&nbsp;The Voice is <a href=#>Gwen Stefani</a> who has a net worth of $150 million.
