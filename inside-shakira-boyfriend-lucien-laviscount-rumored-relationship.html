But while she's a passionate and enthusiastic performer, she's more tight-lipped about her love life. While <a href=#>Shakira talked about her split from Gerard Piqué</a> after their 12-year relationship ended badly, she <strong>hasn't said much about her other partners</strong>.</p><p>In March 2024, Shakira was <strong>linked to Emily In Paris star Lucien Laviscount</strong>, which would be her first romance since her terrible breakup. In this article, we'll take a look at <strong>the dating rumors about Shakira and Laviscount</strong>, along with her past relationships.</p><h2 id=inside-shakira-39-s-rumored-relationship-with-lucien-laviscount>Inside Shakira's Rumored Relationship With Lucien Laviscount</h2><p>At the end of March 2024, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Shakira and Lucien Laviscount went out for dinner</strong></a> in New York City, which led to fans wondering if they were dating. According to Entertainment Tonight, the singer performed in Times Square and then the two stars had a meal at Carbone, an Italian restaurant in Greenwich Village. Shakira and Laviscount looked happy in the photos that were taken of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Why-Shakiras-Net-Worth-Might-Plummet-In-The-Upcoming-Years.jpg><p>If Shakira and Lewis Laviscount are dating, they are <strong>being very secretive about the possible relationship</strong>. Fans should know that <strong>neither star has commented on the dating rumors</strong>. Laviscount appeared in the music video for Shakira's song "Puntería." It's unclear how much time they have spent together since then. If they hung out more than once, then they did so privately and no paparazzi snapped photos.</p><p>The stars pretended to be romantically involved in the music video and both looked great. Besides their dinner in New York City, this is another reason why people wonder if they developed romantic feelings for each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/how-shakira-s-net-worth-enabled-her-to-build-an-impressive-real-estate-portfolio-worth-nearly-40-million-front-shakira-back-_-commons-licences.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Shakira's Net Worth Enabled Her To Build An Impressive Real Estate Portfolio Worth Nearly $40 Million</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Shakira's epic and profitable music career has afforded her a sizable real estate portfolio.</span><p>According to Entertainment Tonight, Lucien Laviscount was at Shakira's concert. Since they seem to have met when he starred in her music video, it's possible that they are just friends who like spending time together and that he wanted to support her NYC performance. Although they were of course aware that photos were taken of them and that people were talking about them, they didn't seem to want to address the rumors publicly and wanted to keep their actual connection a secret.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lucien-laviscourt.jpg><p>If the two are dating, it seems <strong>unlikely that the relationship is serious</strong>. A source told Us Weekly at the end of March 2024 that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shakira would be okay with dating someone if it was "casual."</a>. The source said she "isn't ready for a relationship" and added:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Shakira has a new light around her that she hasn’t had since before Piqué."</p><p>Based on what this source said, it's possible that if Shakira and Lucien Laviscount are dating, it is "casual" and the singer is totally fine with that. Since she shared that she loved Gerard Piqué in several interviews since the beginning of their relationship, she might say more about Laviscount in the future if they are officially together. But as of the time of this writing, she is keeping her dating life a secret.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Women Lucien Laviscount Is Rumored To Have Dated</a> (According to The Sun)</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Celebrity Big Brother star Kerry Kotana</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Strictly Come Dancing cast member Chelsee Healey</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Little Mix's Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jesy Nelson</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>actresses Amy Childs, Dominique Jackson, and Brooke Vincent</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:00</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shakiras-former-nanny-played-a-role-in-her-divorce-from-gerard-pique-and-it-cost-her-big-time-front-deposit-back-shakira-_-youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Shakira's Former Nanny Played A Role In Her Divorce From Gerard Pique, And It Cost Her Big Time</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>According to various sources, Shakira's former nanny, Lili Melgar, played a key role in letting the artist know about Gerard Piqué's infidelity.</span><p>While at the time of this writing, Shakira hasn't talked about Lucien Laviscount and fans can only speculate about their potential connection, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the singer talked about her love life</a> in an interview for the Mexican TV channel Televisa.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lucien-laviscount.jpg><p>She explained that in the past, she <strong>thought that she needed to be in a relationship</strong>. She said:</p><p>“I also fell for this fable that a woman needs a man, because I’ve also always been quite emotionally dependent on men, I have to admit.

This at least suggests that she is open to dating someone whom she meets because of her music career.</p><h2 id=who-has-shakira-dated-besides-gerard-piqu-eacute>Who Has Shakira Dated Besides Gerard Piqué?</h2><p>While the singer's longest relationship was with Gerard Piqué, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shakira has dated several other people</a>. According to Life & Style Magazine, her two most <strong>notable relationships were with</strong><strong>Antonio de la Rúa and Osvaldo Rios</strong>. She and de La Rua dated from 2000 to 2010 and she wrote on her website it was "a mutual decision to take some time apart."

According to Us Weekly, a source said, “Shakira had a great time hanging out with Tom at F1 but she has no interest in dating him. He was really nice and she enjoyed his company, but she isn’t focused on dating him or anybody else at the moment. She has a lot on her plate and is focused on her kids and career for now.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is definitely a <strong>pattern to Shakira's approach to her dating life</strong>.
