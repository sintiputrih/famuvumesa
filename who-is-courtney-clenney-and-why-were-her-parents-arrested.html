Please read with caution.</strong></p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>In 2022, then-26-year-old <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Courtney Clenney</a></strong> was arrested and accused of stabbing and killing her boyfriend, Christian “Toby” Obumseli. Two years later, Obumseli’s murder had not yet gone to trial, but in Jan. 2024, Clenney’s parents were arrested in connection with the case.</p><p data-characters=502 data-current-count=793 data-injectable=true>On April 3, 2022, Miami police responded to a domestic violence call at the residence of Courtney Clenney, an OnlyFans model who had around two million <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram followers</a>. When law enforcement arrived, they found that Toby Obumseli had suffered a stab wound, and he was taken to a nearby hospital, where he later died. In August of that year, Clenney was arrested in Hawaii and charged with second-degree murder, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">USA Today</a> reported. Clenney said she acted in self-defense, and she pleaded not guilty.</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=413 data-injectable=true>Clenney said she threw the knife that killed her boyfriend from a distance of about 10 feet, and only meant to scare him. However, a medical examiner said Obumseli’s wounds could not have been caused by a knife thrown from that far away. According to Clenney’s lawyer, Frank Prieto, “Obumseli attacked her and choked her that evening. Courtney had no choice but to meet force with force.”</p><h2 id=h-video-evidence data-injectable=false>Video evidence</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Untitled-design-66.png><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true>After Christian Obumseli died, police body cam footage later emerged of Courtney Clenney days before Obumseli was killed. In it, the model seeks help from Miami officers regarding another domestic violence incident involving her boyfriend, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WSVN.com</a>. “I want a restraining order against Christian Obumseli,” she said.</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>Meanwhile, a video shared by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS News</a> showed Clenney acting erratically and striking Obumseli in a heated argument months earlier. Referring to the footage, Obsumseli family lawyer Kimberly Wald said, “Domestic violence can happen against a man. And it happens against a larger man. It does happen and men are victims. And Christian was a victim” (via CBS News).</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Clenney’s parents were charged with accessing unauthorized evidence</h2><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=829 data-injectable=true>About two years after Courtney Clenney’s arrest, Clenney’s parents — Kim and Deborah Clenney — were arrested in their home state, Texas, and charged with accessing unauthorized evidence. The charges stem from a group chat between Clenney’s parents and her attorney about cracking Christian Obumseli’s laptop’s PIN, which they had in their possession, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC News </a>reported. Courtney reportedly gave the device to her parents.</p><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>After their arrest, Kim and Deborah were held for a short time in Texas before they were released. As for Clenney, she was seen in court on Thurs. Feb 1, 2024, during which a judge announced a gag order in the high-profile case, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS News</a>. Referencing the computer, the Obumseli family lawyer, Larry Handfield, said, “We believe it’s incriminating evidence, and it goes to a cover-up which [the Obumselis have] always believed.”</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>If you are experiencing domestic abuse, or if you believe someone you know is being abused, contact&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The National Domestic Violence Hotline</a>.
