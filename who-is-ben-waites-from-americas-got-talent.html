He and the other contenders will give their best performances to impress the judges and the live audience in order to advance and maybe win the competition. The AGT competitor is shown singing his original song “True Colors” in an early release preview footage by NBC, which had judge Sofia Vergara cry and offer a standing ovation together with the other two judges, Simon Cowell and Heidi Klum.</p><p>He found Chromesthesia, a form of synthesia in which sounds automatically inspire a perception of color, shape, or movement, during his early singing career. He is a vocal instructor and has devoted his performance to his pupils.</p><h2>Ben Waites was born with a medical problem.</h2><p>Ben Waites’ performance is guaranteed to wow the AGT judges and audience. Given that he received a standing ovation from the judges, he may go to the next round.&nbsp;The singer had to overcome personal challenges in order to compete, and she had to come out strong while still fighting them. However, with the assistance of his music, he has triumphed over his difficulties.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ben-Waites-3.jpg alt="Ben Waites" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Ben was born in 1989 with Arthrogryposis, a medical ailment. This disease affects the joints, most often the arms and legs. Ben, on the other hand, was undeterred, continuing to brighten his and others’ spirits with his songs.&nbsp;The AGT competitor was nurtured by grandparents who instilled in him a strong set of Christian ideals. He was raised with a deep faith in God, which has helped him persevere through terrible circumstances in life. Ben was influenced at an early age by his grandpa, a prominent vocalist and creator of the Gospel Tones Quartet.</p><p>Although he was essentially tone-deaf at first, he quickly developed a “mental vision” in which he could link various colors with his tunes. He matched the colors he imagined to the pitch. He detailed how he found his unusual skill on his website:</p><p>“At first, it puzzled me because I had all these varied hues in my brain.” When I sing, I hear a deep crimson and some green. I can match the pitch and read the style of the music with it. It’s almost as though there’s a link there. That was the main thing that helped me with music. All I had was color since I couldn’t read music or grasp technique.”</p><p></p><h2>Ben Waites Music Journey</h2><p>Ben received his bachelor’s degree in music, communications, and theatrical arts from Louisiana College in December 2010. He got multiple scholarships throughout his undergraduate years and was granted the chance to perform at his own graduation. His grandpa died the same year, but the AGT competitor hopes to carry on his heritage.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ben-Waites-2.jpg alt="Ben Waites" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>His hits include My Wonderful Lord, He Giveth More Grace, All That Thrills My Soul Is Jesus, and Real as I Believe, his most recent. Ben has also performed in churches around the nation. The itinerary may be found on his official website, which is indicated on his Instagram account.</p><p>America’s Got Talent (AGT) has been renewed for Season 17 due to the popularity of prior seasons. Many of the finalists have gone on to become household stars with global recognition. The current group of competitors has drawn inspiration from previous victors for their efforts this year.</p><p>Ben’s complete audition will air on NBC on Tuesday, July 12th.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBursSnZLCZmamytHnFq6amZZGisrO1wpqqZp%2BfqXq1rcuepa1n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bill-russell-children-jacob-russell-karen-kenyatta-william-russell-jr.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jacob Russell, Karen Kenyatta, William Russell Jr.">&larr;
