You’re pulling our leg.” The reporter then showed them the family tree graph that connects Hanks to Mister Rogers. Based on the graph, the two are sixth cousins related through a shared ancestor named Johannes Meffert.</p><p>The graph showed that Johannes Meffert’s two sons, Jacob Mefford and William Mefford, led to the subsequent bloodlines that produced Hanks and Mister Rogers, respectively. The stunning reveal about Hanks’ family ties with Mister Rogers was officially confirmed by Ancestry.com.</p><p>“Fred Rogers and Tom Hanks are sixth cousins sharing the same 5x great-grandfather … who immigrated from Germany to America in the 18th century,” Ancestry spokeswoman Keri Madonna told CNN.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-252590 alt="Portrait Of Mister Fred Rogers" width=900 height=612 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/portrait-of-mister-fred-rogers.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-252590 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Mister Rogers was so popular that his show ran for more than 30 years.</span></p><p>The discovery came as a shock not only to Hanks and his wife, Rita, but to the rest of the actor’s fans.
