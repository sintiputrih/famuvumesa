She was the eighth child among nine children born to her parents and right from childhood, she became a part of the family’s show business.</p><p>Her first experience of her family’s show business was at the age of four when she appeared with her brothers on The Andy Williams Show as part of The Osmond Brothers. Although it would be her only appearance with the group until the 70s, she continued to hone her skills as a singer and in 1973, she released her first single, Paper Roses, which quickly shot up to the top of the Billboard Country Music chart. The single began a lifetime of musical success for Marie Osmond and although she was part of an album release in 1972 for, I’m a Little Bit Country, her first solo album as a successful hitmaker was in 1973 with Paper Roses.</p><p>Over the course of her career, she released nine more albums, with several of them charting on the Billboard Chart.</p><p>Since she made her debut as an entertainer, however, she has expanded into other forms of entertainment such as acting, which she debuted in&nbsp;Hugo the Hippo in 1975. She has starred in over 17 movies or TV shows and has also hosted a variety show, Donny & Marie, alongside her brother, which lasted from 1976 to 1979.</p><p>She has also performed on Broadway and has had her own radio show.

Their fiery love produced an offspring, a son named Stephen James Craig on 20th of April, 1983.</p><p>Unfortunately, their love story ended shortly after in October 1985, albeit temporarily. After a couple of decades, Marie Osmond and Stephen Lyle Craig reconnected and got married to each other again on the 4th of May, 2011, in a small ceremony held in one of Las Vegas’ venues, Nevada Temple. The couple has remained together ever since.</p><p>Before her second marriage to Stephen Lyle Craig, Marie Osmond was married to Brian Blosil and the couple was together for 21 years between October 1986 and March 2007. During their time together, the couple gave birth to two children, a girl named Rachel Lauren and a son named Matthew Richard.</p><p>Aside from their biological children, Marie Osmond and Brian Blosil also adopted five children – Jessica Marie, Michael Bryan, Brandon Warren, Brianna Patricia, and Abigail Oliver May.
