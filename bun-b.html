We will notify you if any information is made public.</p><h2>What is Bun B Famous for?</h2><p>Being half of the famed southern rap duo UGK, which has recorded multiple successful albums, including Underground Kingz, which debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 charts in the United States.<br>The success of his studio album, Trill OG, which debuted at #4 on the Billboard 200 in the United States.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12673092-6956165-image-a-125_155-265x300.jpeg><h2>Where is Bun B born?</h2><p>Bun B, also known as Bernard Freeman, was born in Port Arthur, Texas, in the United States. He is of African-American descent and a member of the black ethnic group. Pisces is his zodiac sign.</p><p>We don’t know anything about his parents or his education. He does, however, have a sibling whose identity remains unknown. Please use the comment section to let us know if you have or know anything about his parents.</p><p>When did Bun B decide to pursue a career in music?<br>In the late 1980s, Pimp C formed the rap team UGK. He first released a demo tape called “Underground King” that didn’t include Bun B. Alternatively, it included Mitchell Queen, a buddy of Pimp C’s. Bun and his friend Jalon Jackson formed P.A. Militia, which was their own band. The two organizations merged to form the 4 Black Ministers group.<br>Later, Queen and Jackson quit the group, leaving Pimp C and Bun B, who decided to rejoin UGK. Underground King, a demo Pimp C recorded with Mitchell Queen, caught the attention of Bigtyme Records, a Houston-based independent label. They then published The Southern Way, an extended play.<br>Jive Records took notice of this album when it was released. Many of the songs on their debut album, Too Hard to Swallow, had content that was too explicit for the album, therefore Bigtyme Records published an extended play named Banned, which included all of the songs that were too explicit for Too Hard to Swallow, before the album was released. The song “Pocket Full of Stones” was the first by UGK to receive widespread exposure in the United States. In 1994, they released their second album, Super Tight… Ridin’ Dirty, their third album, reached number two on the R&B charts and number 15 on the Billboard 200 in 1996. Pimp C was sentenced to prison after releasing their fourth studio album, Dirty Money.<br>In January 2014, Bun B announced “The Trillest Tour.” On January 30, the Houston native announced his tour dates, which he would be joined by Kirko Bangz, another Houston native. From March 6 through April 17, 2014, the tour was on the road.<br>Aside from music, he and author Shea Serrano collaborated on a coloring book named “Bun B’s Rap Coloring Book” in 2013. Freeman and Serrano have previously discussed collaborating on a book. Initially, they intended to collaborate on a “hip hop survival guide,” but they later decided against it. Serrano later drew and released coloring pages of rappers on Tumblr. The pages rapidly became popular. After that, Freeman and Serrano decided to create an entire coloring book.<br>He is also a Distinguished Lecturer on the Rice University faculty. He offered a Hip-Hop and Religion course at the School of the Humanities.</p><h2>Is Bun B a married man or woman?</h2><p>Bun B was a married man, which reflected his personal life. Angela Walls, his wife, is his life partner. Since 2003, they’ve been dating. He became stepfather to Angela’s two children from a previous relationship after their marriage. Bun B’s previous affairs are not documented in the media. As of now, there are no reports of divorce or separation between the pair.</p><p>Bun B shot an armed invader who was attempting to loot his Houston house on April 24, 2019. The intruder took off running. DeMonte Jackson, the suspect, was apprehended by Houston police shortly after arriving at the hospital.</p><h2>Bun B’s height:</h2><p>According to his physique measurements, he stands at 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighs roughly 104 kilograms. Likewise, he has black eyes and black hair. His chest, waist, and biceps all measure 44-38-15 inches.
