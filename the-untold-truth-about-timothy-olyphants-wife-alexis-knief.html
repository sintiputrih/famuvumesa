She was born under the Zodiac sign Capricorn on 1 January 1970 in Southern California, USA, and holds American nationality. Even though very <a rel=nofollow href=#>little information is known</a> about her, Timothy is known to praise her and call her ‘a smart and intelligent woman’. She has definitely been a huge support to Olyphant in balancing his demanding roles as an actor, a husband and a father.</p><h2><span id=Early_life_and_biography>Early life and biography</span></h2><p>Not much information is available about her early life and family, mostly because Alexis has managed to stay out of the limelight for decades.</p><p>What is known is that she attended the University of Southern California, where she met Timothy and they fell in love. It’s also unknown what type of degree Alexis obtained, and regarding her career, she has never disclosed any information about her job, and is mostly known as a housewife and a mother. Throughout the last decades, rumors were circulating about her entrepreneurial or business undertaking, but as with other things, details have remained unknown and unconfirmed – she even shuns social media.</p><h2><span id=Briefly_about_Timothy_Olyphant>Briefly about Timothy Olyphant</span></h2><p>Timothy was born in Hawaii, but has spent most of his life in California. Olyphant showed interest in swimming at a young age, and pursued this interest throughout high school under coach Darell Lohrke. He proved to be very good at swimming, and in 1986 he competed in the finals of the national championship in the 200m freestyle. After graduating from Fred C. Neyer High School, he attended the University of Southern California to study fine arts. Soon after, Olyphant <a rel=nofollow href=#>began taking acting classes</a>, and after graduation, he moved to New York to study acting.</p><p>He made his debut with a minor role in the ”First Wives Club“, while in ”Scream 2” he played the cynical student Mickey. In 2000, he starred in the action movie ”Missing in 60 Seconds” with Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall. Timothy Olyphant starred in a variety of genres, some of which are ”Die Hard 4.0”, ”Neighborhood Girl”, ”Madmen”, ”Mercenary”, etc. His most prominent roles were in HBO’s western ”Deadwood”, in which he was given the lead role of Sheriff Seth Bullock, and the lead role in the TV series ”Righteous”. Olyphant is also known to have starred in other TV series, such as ”The Office” and do the voiceovers for computer games and animated movies.</p><h2><span id=Rumors_about_their_divorce>Rumors about their divorce</span></h2><p>A&nbsp;few years ago there were rumors circulating about their possible divorce. It seemed that Timothy himself added fuel to the fire when he made a joke about divorcing Alexis, in winning the Emmy Award that he was nominated for – Outstanding Lead Actor – for his role in ”Justified”. The award was taken by Kyle Chandler for his role of Coach Eric Taylor in the acclaimed series Friday Night Lights. Later he said in an interview, that it was just a witty remark and that it originated from Alex herself.</p><p>Talking with the TV host Conan O’Brian, Timothy said:&nbsp;“Kyle Chandler won the Emmy award, it was lovely, I was very happy for him. My opening line — this was my wife’s idea actually — I was going to look at [the trophy] and then look out at my wife of twenty years and say, ‘Well, honey, this is it. I’m finally leaving you,”&nbsp;Olyphant said jokingly to TV host Conan O’Brien. This shows what type of relationship they have; one filled with patience, love, and humor.</p><p>Their marriage also came into the limelight, after Timothy was seen wearing his wedding ring on his right hand, sparking rumors that their marriage had maybe come to an end. Timothy soon denied the rumors, and simply stated that he likes to wear his ring on his right hand.</p><p>Also many have wondered how they manage to stay married for decades, given it is such a rarity in Hollywood. Many failed Hollywood marriages show that with busy schedules, and frequent separations being the nature of jobs &nbsp;it’s can be hard to make a marriage last, and that is why their marriage is praised as one-of-a-kind. Even Timothy himself has said that bonds like theirs are very rare in Hollywood, stating <a rel=nofollow href=#>in his interview</a> with Women’s Health Magazine: “You have to be with the right person, and you both have to be willing to do the work, day in and day out, to make it happen.”</p><h2><span id=Physical_statistics_hobbies>Physical statistics, hobbies</span></h2><p>Regarding her physical stats, Alexis is 5ft 8ins (177cm) tall, has light green eyes and blonde hair. Little is known about her hobbies and interests, but judging from the gowns she wears at award events, she is a lady, who enjoys simplicity and moderation in fashion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thebiography.org///thebiography.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/9afbe707df87d1391da2f49331d0f1fc-676x1024.jpg><h2><span id=What_is_her_networth>What is her networth?</span></h2><p>Given that so little information is available about Alexis, it is hard to know her net worth, but as of early 2020, it’s estimated to be around $1 million. On the other hand, her husband has <a rel=nofollow href=#>reportedly</a> amassed over $20 million through his prolific career.</p><h2><span id=Her_marriage_to_Timothy_Olyphant>Her marriage to Timothy Olyphant</span></h2><p>College sweethearts Timothy and Alexis married in July 1991 in a private ceremony. They now have three children, welcomed Grace Kathrine in 1999, Henry in 2001, and second daughter Vivian in 2003. Currently, they live in Westwood in&nbsp; Los Angeles.</p><p>Even though Alexis does a good job of being a woman of mystery, she is known to attend events with her husband, and those are the <a rel=nofollow href=#>rare occasions</a> where she’s seen in public.</p><p>Despite the rumors and jokes about divorcing, the couple has been together for 30 years, and it seems that they will continue staying strong.</p><h2><span id=Is_she_active_on_social_media>Is she active on social media?</span></h2><p>Unusually for a celebrity wife, Alexis has kept a low profile all these years, and stayed out of scandals and controversies. Keeping with that trend, she doesn’t use social platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or even Instagram. Who knows, maybe it is the ability of these spouses to separate private life from professional, and not expose all the details of their marriage and their life together on social platforms, that’s the recipe for a long and succesful marriage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqvqrvGq5ipoKljvLOzjq2fnmWlo8GwuMNmq6utpJ16oq7OrqtmrJmivLW02GampbGgna6vwNJmrqKelWKurbHXoqpmo56esqd7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-dennis-kucinich-robert-f-kennedy-jr-s-campaign-manager-652995-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Dennis Kucinich, Robert F Kennedy Jr.s campaign manager?">&larr;
