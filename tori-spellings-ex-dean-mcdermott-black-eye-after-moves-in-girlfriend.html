Dean announced his divorce from Tori in a note shared to his socials, which he quickly deleted, briefly prompting speculation of a reconciliation. However, Tori has since confirmed they’re moving forward with the divorce, and Dean’s new relationship status is further proof they’ve moved on from one another.</p><p>"Dean’s saying he and Lily are in love and ready for the next step," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source said, Ok Magazine! reports.</a></p><p>"She’s been amazingly supportive of his journey to sobriety, and they’re spending so much time together, it just made sense for him to move in," they continued, adding that Dean’s issues with substance abuse as well as infidelity contributed to his and Tori’s decision to end their marriage. He spent several months in a sober living facility following their break-up and started his relationship with Lily a few months later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was like, whatever makes you happy. Tori has moved on too," the source said, noting Tori didn’t have a problem when she learned her estranged husband was taking the next step with his girlfriend.</p><p>Tori and Dean tied the know in May 2006 in a ceremony in Fiji, after meeting on the set of the TV movie Mind Over Murder in 2005. At the time, both Spelling and McDermott were married to other people. Tori Spelling was wed to actor-writer Charlie Shanian from 2004 to 2006, while Dean McDermott was married to actress Mary Jo Eustace from 1993 to 2006, with whom he shares a son named Jack, born in 1998.</p><p>During their relationship, Tori and Dean appeared together on several reality shows, notably Tori & Dean: Inn Love (2007-2012) and Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood (2008-2012). They share five children: Liam (born 2007), Stella (born 2008), Hattie (born 2011), Finn (born 2012), and Beau (born 2017). The former couple’s divorce has yet to be finalized.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKqZYsCxsculoKefo2KyuXnDnpinZZ2Ysaa%2BzKirrWWSoa6kt4yesJ5lkZvBpr6MpqavnaNitq95xqKppZ6inrKvsI4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sister-wives-sneak-peek-robyn-brown-says-being-happy-with-kody-feels-disrespectful-exclusive-216512.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Sister Wives' Sneak Peek: Robyn Brown Says Being Happy With Kody Feels 'Disrespectful' (Exclusive)">&larr;
