Currently, he is known for being a businessman.</p><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich Steve Garvey is? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the total size of Steve’s net worth is over $5 million, as of mid- 2016. Most of his income is the result of his successful involvement in the sports industry as a professional MLB player. Another source of his wealth is represented by his involvement in the business industry.</p><h3>Steve Garvey Net Worth $5 Million</h3><p>Steve Garvey spent his childhood in his hometown, Tampa, where he began training baseball and football, both at the same time. Upon matriculation from Chamberlain High School, he enrolled at Michigan State University, where he continued to play both; however, he soon decided to concentrate on baseball, at which he subsequently distinguished himself, to the extent where his jersey number 10 was retired in 2014.</p><p>Steve’s professional baseball career began in the mid-1980s, when he entered the 1968 MLB Draft, in which he was selected in the first round by the Los Angeles Dodgers. In the following season he made his debut, and immediately showed that he was the real deal. Initially, he played in the position of third base, later transferring to first base in 1973 when Wes Parker retired. While there, he became a part of the most enduring infield in baseball history, together with Davey Lopes, a second baseman, Ron Cey, a third baseman, and <a href=#>Bill Russell</a>, a shortstop. In 1974, Steve won the NL MVP award, and thanks to his skills in the 1978 National League Championship Series, where the team defeated the Philadelphia Phillies, he earned the League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award. He played for the Dodgers until 1982, during which period his net worth increased to a large degree.<br>As a player with the Dodgers, he had in total 1,727 games over 14 seasons, hit .301 with 211 homers and 992 RBI. Steve also won the All-Star Game MVP Award, Roberto Clemente Award, and four times Gold Glove Awards from 1974 to 1977.</p><p>Speaking about his further career, in 1982 he was acquired by the San Diego Padres, signing a contract worth $6.6 million over five years, considerably increasing his net worth. During his first season with the Padres, he reached the National League’s record with 1207 consecutive games played, and in the next season, he won his second National League Championship Series MVP award, as he led the team to a win against the Chicago Cubs. He stayed with the team until his retirement in 1987.</p><p>Thanks to his skills, Steve was included in the book “The 100 Greatest Baseball Players Of All Time”, released by Donald Honig and Lawrence Ritter. Beside that, he was also inducted into the Michigan State University Athletics Hall of Fame, as well as in the Irish-American Hall of Fame.</p><p>Speaking about his career in the field of business, Steve established Garvey Communications, a company which is involved in television production, contributing further to his net worth.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Steve Garvey was married twice. With his first wife, actress Cyndy Garvey (1971-1983), he has two children. His second wife was Candace Garvey from 1989 to 1997; they are the parents of three children. He has two residences – Los Angeles, and Palm Desert, both in California.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=11.503436426117><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Steve Garvey</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 22, 1948</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Tampa, Florida, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.78 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>87&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Baseball player</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Michigan State University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Candace Garvey (m. 1989), Cyndy Garvey (m. 1971–1983)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Children</td><td>Whitney Garvey, Slade Garvey, Olivia Garvey, Krisha Garvey, Ryan Steven Patrick Garvey, Sean Garvey</td></tr><tr readability=0.35897435897436><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/stevegarvey6</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004953/</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>National League Most Valuable Player Award</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Buzzcocks</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Movies</td><td>The Sandlot 2, Direct Hit, The Gong Show Movie</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=75.661649353403><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=4.2222222222222><td>1</td><td>Appeared in an infomercial, hosted by sports reporter <a href=#>Kirsten Gum</a>, for "Bosley" hair replacement.
