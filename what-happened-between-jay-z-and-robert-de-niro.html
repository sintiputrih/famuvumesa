So some people were surprised when he had a feud with the two-time Oscar winner Robert De Niro.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Hiring A Nanny Does Not Come Cheap For BeyoncÃ© And Jay-Z">Hiring A Nanny Does Not Come Cheap For Beyoncé And Jay-Z</a></span></p><p>For those who listen to Jay-Z’s music, Jay-Z’s admiration for the iconic actor Robert De Niro is pretty evident through his songs. De Niro has been referenced on the business mogul’s song on more than occasion.</p><p>Suffice to say that he really admired the work of the actor. However, it was reported that De Niro and Jay-Z argued during a party in 2012. So what exactly happened between the rapper and the actor?</p><h2 id=jay-z-rsquo-s-feud-with-his-fellow-musicians>Jay-Z’s Feud With His Fellow Musicians</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jay-Z had a shading battle with fellow musicians Eminem and 50 cent earlier this year. The issue started after Eminem refused to appear on the 2022 <a href=#>Super Bowl halftime show</a> without 50 Cent. It was revealed that Jay-Z said that the white boy Eminem does not want to do the SuperBowl without 50 cent.</p><p>50 cent was quick to defend the Lose Yourself singer, he stated “Why did he say the white boy, why he didn’t say the biggest rap artist in the world? Happy Easter! man enjoy the holidays,”.</p><p>The In The Club singer did not stop there, he even uploaded a photo collage of the late painter Jean-Michel Basquiat and a photo of Jay-Z imitating Basquiat on his Instagram account. The husband of BeyonceÌ can be seen having the same dreadlock hairstyle for a Halloween party in 2014.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="BeyoncÃ©'s 'First Love' Cheated On Her Multiple Times, Then She Left Him For Jay-Z">Beyoncé's 'First Love' Cheated On Her Multiple Times, Then She Left Him For Jay-Z</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the supposed feud between the three music icons, it seems like it was just a publicity stunt since 50 Cent indirectly admitted to it himself.</p><p>When asked about his current relationship with the business mogul, 50 Cent told MTV News “It's not like we have something against each other to make us enemies. Me and Jay will use each other. Repeatedly. For energy.” He further commented: “We don't call each other for no reason.”</p><h2 id=robert-de-niro-rsquo-s-feud-with-other-actors>Robert De Niro’s Feud With Other Actors</h2><p>Through the course of Robert De Niro’s career, he’s had his fair share of troubles with his fellow celebrities. One of the most well-known feuds he’s had with a fellow actor was with Mickey Rourke.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The highly publicized feud between Robert De Niro and Mickey Rourke had spanned for decades. Rourke and De Niro’s misunderstanding started on the set of the 1987 film Angel Heart.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Robert De Niro Got Scammed Millions By A New York Art Gallery That Illegally Sold His Father's Paintings">Robert De Niro Got Scammed Millions By A New York Art Gallery That Illegally Sold His Father's Paintings</a></span></p><p>At the time, the<a href=#> actor who has created onscreen magic with Scorsese</a> has been in the entertainment industry for more two decades and when he was set to star alongside the boxer-turned-actor Mickey Rourke, he was already a superstar in Hollywood.</p><p>De Niro was apparently aloof towards Rourke at the set of the film. De Niro who’s known for his method acting strategies might have been acting distant due to the conflict of their characters on the film.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rourke took offense at De Niro’s refusal</a> to talk to him on-set. Despite the relatively obscure dispute between the two actors that happened years ago, Rourke opened up about it in his 2019 interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor revealed that De Niro’s action hurt his feelings since he’s a relatively new to the acting industry, and he used to look up to De Niro since he’s already established on the industry. The falling out between the two stars is way more understandable compared the dispute between De Niro and rapper Jay-Z.</p><h2 id=the-feud-between-jay-z-and-robert-de-niro>The Feud Between Jay-Z and Robert De Niro</h2><p>Jay-Z had shown his admiration for De Niro’s work numerous times through the years. <a href=#>Blue Ivy’s billionaire father</a> has referenced the legendary actor in some of his songs such as Empire State of Mind and Fallin. Despite the billionaire’s admiration for the actor, the two of them apparently exchanged some words that did not end well during a party.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The incident happened on Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in 2012, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">De Niro apparently started the dispute</a> between them. Someone who saw the incident spilled the beans and said “Bob was sitting at a table, and when Jay went over to say hello, De Niro told Jay that he never called him back. He told Jay that if somebody calls you six times, you call them back. It doesn’t matter who you are, that is just rude.”</p><p>Many onlookers were quite agitated about the whole thing since De Niro’s behavior escalated quickly. One of the bystanders talked about De Niro’s manners and said “He can be quite scary when he’s angry.” BeyonceÌ apparently tried to pacify the situation but sadly Jay-Z and De Niro’s feud became an ongoing thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked about Robert De Niro, Jay-Z was quick to air his side during his guest appearance on The Breakfast Club, stating “I treat people based on who they are. Who they really are. Not the name, not Robert De Niro. Who you are as a person. It doesn’t matter who you are, everyone has to be respectful.”</p><p>Thankfully, it was reported that the pair ended their feud in 2016 despite the absence of public apology from both parties. Since the apparent feud ended, the power couple was publicly seen supporting De Niro’s work on different occasions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmopGuert5wKebZqqfl7KzwIydnGammae8cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-the-cast-of-amazons-daisy-jones-the-six-is-up-to-next-sam-clafin-riley-keough.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What The Cast Of Amazon's Daisy Jones &amp;amp; The Six Is Up To Next">&larr;
