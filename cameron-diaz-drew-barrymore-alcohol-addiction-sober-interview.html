It's those wonderful friends, including Cameron Diaz, in fact, who stood by her side when things weren't so bright and shiny and she was fighting her addiction battle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a new profile of Barrymore in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=noopener data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-03-05/for-real-drew-barrymore-talk-show data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Los Angeles Times" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">The Los Angeles Times</a>, Diaz discussed her longtime friend's former troubles with alcohol abuse and how she supported her through them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Barrymore has previously spoken of how, after gaining fame as a child actor, she developed a drinking problem at the age of 11, became addicted to cocaine at 12, and was put into rehab for attempting suicide at 13. Through the years, she worked to get clean, but when in 2016 her third marriage failed, she relapsed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The profile revealed that the actress began to drink heavily and constantly following her 2016 split from ex-husband Will Kopelman. The breakup came after the 50 First Dates star had somewhat decided to put her career on hold and move to New York City with Kopelman to raise their daughters—Olive, 10, and Frankie, 8—near his family. When the relationship did not work out, however, Barrymore turned to alcohol, causing her longtime therapist to dismiss her as a client, and alienating some of her friends.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Diaz said that time was "difficult to watch."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"But I knew that if we all stuck with her and gave her the support she needed, she would find her way," Diaz told the outlet. "I have absolute faith in her. You can't even comprehend how hard it was to be her as a child, and then she shot out the other end with the ability to save herself."</p><img alt="actress lucy liu, actress drew barrymore and actress cameron diaz attend the charlies angels hollywood premiere on october 22, 2000 at manns chinese theatre in hollywood, california photo by ron galella, ltdron galella collection via getty images" title="Ron Galella Archive - File Photos 2010" width=1024 height=704 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-155209474-6408edbc8bbcb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Ron Galella, Ltd.</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Barrymore and Diaz, who starred in the 2000 cult-classic Charlie's Angels together, have been close friends since the '90s. And now that she's a show host, Barrymore has welcomed Diaz on set various times.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Barrymore has talked about her sobriety journey and past addiction troubles on her show, and in the profile, she admitted it was the offer she got from CBS in 2019 to host her own talk show that pushed her to make a real change in her life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think the opportunity at a show like this really hit me," she said.
