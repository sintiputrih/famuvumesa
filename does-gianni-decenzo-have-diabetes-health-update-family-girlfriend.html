Gianni DeCenzo received his well-deserved recognition for portraying Demetri Alexopoulos in the YouTube Premium and Netflix series Cobra Kai, despite having been active for over a decade.</strong></p><p>Cobra Kai is a continuation of the iconic Karate Kid series. The fifth season of the show will premiere on September 9, 2022.</p><h2><span id=Illness_of_Gianni_DeCenzo_Does_He_Have_Diabetes>Illness of Gianni DeCenzo: Does He Have Diabetes?</span></h2><p>Since the age of 13, Gianni DeCenzo has lived with Type 1 diabetes, also known as Juvenile Diabetes. At the age of 15, he was formally diagnosed two years later.</p><p>Unlike Type 2 diabetes, which is more prevalent in adults and has nothing to do with lifestyle, Type 1 diabetes is inherited. It is more common in infants and adolescents.</p><p>Gianni has not, however, allowed the disease to govern him. He is very forthright and vocal about his health condition, which he does not attempt to conceal.</p><p>On World Diabetes Day, he utilized social media to raise awareness about this chronic health condition by sharing his own experience with it. According to him, having this ailment is difficult, but it improves over time.</p><p>Gianni DeCenzo’s social media accounts, including Instagram and Twitter, are constantly updated with posts and other content. Instagram is his most active platform.</p><p>The Cobra Kai actor is physically active and works out to maintain his health and fitness. In addition, he prefers diet Coke to conventional Coke.</p><p>Currently, DeCenzo can be found filming, attending movie premieres, and having fun with his family and friends.</p><p>Additionally, Gianni appreciates when individuals with comparable health conditions reach out to him.</p><h2><span id=Family_of_Gianni_DeCenzo_Who_Are_His_Parents>Family of Gianni DeCenzo: Who Are His Parents?</span></h2><p>Gianni DeCenzo was born in Los Angeles, California, on October 27, 2001. His parents were both actors. His father proposed to his mother during an acting class in which they met.</p><p>Therefore, he believed he was destined to be an actor. We could say that acting is a family trait.</p><p>However, his parents’ identities remain unknown.</p><p>Additionally, he has a sibling named Anthony DeCenzo. After the birth of the DeCenzo siblings, their parents gave up acting to focus on rearing them.</p><p>DeCenzo’s race has never been disclosed. However, we can deduce from his surname that he is Caucasian and from Sardinia, the second largest island in the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p>DeCenzo made his cinematic debut in 2011 with the short film The Lucky One. He has appeared in more than 19 films or television series, such as Liv and Maddie, Coop and Cammi Ask the World, NCIS, and Cobra Kai.</p><h2><span id=Girlfriend_of_Gianni_DeCenzo_Who_is_Melissa_Rivera>Girlfriend of Gianni DeCenzo: Who is Melissa Rivera?</span></h2><p>Gianni and his fiancée Melissa Rivera have been together for over two years. They began their relationship in 2019.</p><p>However, their exact anniversary date is uncertain. Melissa shared an anniversary post on November 3, whereas Gianni did so in May.</p><p>The pair frequently appear on one another’s Instagram and travel extensively together.</p><p>Rivera turned 20 on April 7, 2022, making her nearly the same age as her partner Gianni, with only about six months separating them in age.</p><p>Mary Mouser, who co-stars with Gianni, also has diabetes. Mary Mouser, Gianni DeCenzo’s Cobra Kai co-star, has also fought a comparable battle with diabetes. In January 2021, the American actress who portrays Gianni’s teammate Samantha LaRusso was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes.</p><p>She admitted that she uses an insulin device to regulate the disease. Initially, she was embarrassed and attempted to conceal it. However, she has grown accustomed to it and no longer considers it objectionable.</p><p>Ralph Macchio, Elisabeth Shue, and William Zabka starred in the original Karate Kid, which was released in 1984, seventeen years before Gianni DeCenzo was born. But due to his father, he developed a special appreciation for the film.</p><p>Gianni’s opportunity to feature in Cobra Kai was memorable for the father and son duo.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Kelly Price&#39;s Partner, Spouse, Children, And Parents"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1086337,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/kelly-prices-partner-spouse-children-and-parents/"}{"1":63}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Kelly Price’s Partner, Spouse, Children, And Parents</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Is Jake Ferguson Dating Anyone | Relationship And Family Detail</a></h3>In 2019, Meagan Bumgarner's relationship with Jake Ferguson was a hot topic.
