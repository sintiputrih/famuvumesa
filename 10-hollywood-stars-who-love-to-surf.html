The current surfing period started worldwide, including its birthplace in Hawaii, California, and Australia. There have been upswings and downturns in <a href=#>the popularity of surfing</a> since then. Still, the sport is experiencing unprecedented growth in its mainstream appeal and global distribution. There are surfers in Hawaii, Bali, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Brazil, California, Morocco, and everywhere. Surfing is so much fun that even celebrities enjoy it. Here are ten actors who love to surf:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Are Drew Barrymore And Adam Sandler Going To Film Another Movie Together?">Are Drew Barrymore And Adam Sandler Going To Film Another Movie Together?</a></span></p><h2 id=adam-sandler><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Adam Sandler</span></h2><p>The first surfing photo of Adam Sandler ever taken was of him surfing in Malibu. Since then, he has developed a passion for the activity and is using his celebrity status to promote charitable organizations. He has been working with the incredible Life Rolls On Foundation, which provides opportunities to surf and skate for people coping with various disabilities. According to SurferToday, Paris Hilton even paid $20,000 to surf with the legendary comic.</p><h2 id=chris-hemsworth><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Chris Hemsworth</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Hemsworth</a> has a significant amount of experience working in the film industry. Throughout his career, he has portrayed several favorite characters among the audience. In addition to being an actor, he also has a reputation for being adventurous, especially at the beach, where you can frequently find him riding the waves. During a trip to Australia for vacation a few years ago, the actor decided to pass on his passion for surfing to his daughter, who was then five years old. In previous years, he has been seen riding a wave at the beach with friends, family, or even himself.</p><h2 id=zac-efron><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Zac Efron</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2002, Zac Efron began his career as an actor on television, but he did not become widely known until 2006, when he starred as the main character in the Disney Channel <a href=#>movie High School Musical.</a> Since surfing is one of Efron's favorite activities, the actor was frequently spotted partaking in the activity. Even more impressively, in 2010, he participated in Oakley's Learn to Ride surfing day charity event, which took place on Bondi Beach in Australia.</p><h2 id=cameron-diaz><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Cameron Diaz</span></h2><p>A fantastic illustration of how increased celebrity does not automatically confer the ability to surf is the world-famous A-list superstar who has blown everyone away since she made her debut. Knowing that there are famous people who don't mind getting their hair wet provides a sense of calmness to the situation. Even though the activity caused her to suffer a broken nose, she refused to let that deter her from continuing to compete. Cameron created a show based on her surfing travels titled Tripping.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Did Barbie Make Margot Robbie The Highest-Paid Actress In Hollywood?">Did Barbie Make Margot Robbie The Highest-Paid Actress In Hollywood?</a></span></p><h2 id=margot-robbie><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Margot Robbie</span></h2><p>Her early attempts at surfing included several hilarious wipe outs that have since become famous. However, that did not prevent her from having a strong passion for the sport. She thanked the paparazzi for capturing her at her most flattering angles later. Nevertheless, Robbie was no exception to the rule that most Australians are natural surfers. Nissan Motors even pounced on the opportunity to recruit her as their ambassador for environmentally friendly electric automobiles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vanessa-hudgens><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Vanessa Hudgens</span></h2><p>Since she was spotted surfing for the first time with her ex-boyfriend and <a href=#>co-star in High School Musical</a>, Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens has made it a point to visit the beach frequently. Vanessa was spotted in Bali in 2013 at the Oakley Pro and catching a couple of waves at Playgrounds in Nusa Lembongan. It turned out that she had a regular footing and a realistic style even though it was unconventional when it came to surfing.</p><h2 id=matthew-mcconaughey><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Matthew McConaughey</span></h2><p>​​​​​​​</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Matthew has always been a man who is both attractive and physically fit. He was one of the main characters in Surfer, Dude (2008). After that, he began his instruction in the actual skill of surfing. He claims that he became addicted to it. The guy lived the California lifestyle but was born and raised in Texas. He developed such a passion for the sport of surfing that many of the scenes in his movies include him surfing. He has even gone so far as to park his trailer close to a beach, so he can go surfing and has made friends with Kelly Slater. Even his home is near the water.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="These Andrew Garfield Movies Missed The Mark With Fans">These Andrew Garfield Movies Missed The Mark With Fans</a></span></p><h2 id=andrew-garfield><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Andrew Garfield</span></h2><p>​​​​​​​</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A few months back, in 2022, while Andrew Garfield was on vacation in Malibu, he was spotted wearing his wetsuit and surfing.

Liam smoothly rode the pounding waves while balancing on his white surfboard while the paparazzi watched him perform.
