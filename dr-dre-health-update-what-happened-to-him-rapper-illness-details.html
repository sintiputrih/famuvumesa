Dr. Dre, real name Andre Romelle Young, claimed that his doctors worried he wouldn’t survive the brain aneurysm he was diagnosed with in January 2021. In a recent interview clip shared on Diverse Mentality’s Instagram, the rapper discussed his experience, stating he didn’t know how serious it was until after the incident.</p><p>While anybody may develop a brain aneurysm, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke indicates that between the ages of 30 and 60, women are more likely than males to get one. According to a June 2021 interview with the Los Angeles Times, untreated hypertension, which Dr. Dre believes may have been the cause for his aneurysm, was stated to have elevated risk for certain persons with underlying health concerns.</p><h2>Is Dr. Dre ill? His Struggle with a Brain Aneurysm</h2><p>On January 5, 2021, it was discovered that Dr. Dre was ill due to a brain aneurysm. He had been taken the day before to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. He was being checked in the intensive care unit to see what caused the brain hemorrhage. The day after being brought to the hospital, Dre rushed to Instagram to reassure his fans that he was alright.</p><p>Dre allegedly needed emergency evacuation to the critical care unit at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles in January 2021, according to the music producer. According to reports, Dre said that since the event happened around the commencement of the epidemic, he was not authorized to invite any visitors. Dre said that they had to wake him up every hour on the hour for two weeks in order to do sobriety tests.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Dr-Dre-1.jpg alt="Dr Dre" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Dr. Dre’s Health Update: How Is He Now?</h2><p>Dr. Dre appeared to recover quickly after the scare. He spoke out about his health for the first time in June 2021, telling the Los Angeles Times that he was “feeling wonderful” barely five months after being taken to the hospital. He also used dialogue to urge people to keep track of their health and see their doctor on a regular basis. Dre admits to having peculiar feelings regarding his high blood pressure while in the ICU.</p><p>He said that he had always put his health first. However, there is a link between Black men and high blood pressure that he was unaware of. He did, however, declare that he is taking care of himself. Dre sent a health update on Instagram immediately after being brought to the hospital, saying he was doing well.</p><h2>Did Dr. Dre Nearly Die? His Close Encounter with Death</h2><p>Dr. Dre has gone up about his experience with a brain aneurysm that placed him in the critical care unit of a Los Angeles hospital early last year.&nbsp;Doctors encouraged his family to remain with him at that time because they were concerned he might die as a result of the tragedy, he revealed in a recent Workout The Doubt podcast interview.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Dr-Dre-2.jpg alt="Dr Dre" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He said that because of Covid, the physicians had prohibited any guests or family members from coming up. They did, however, let his family in, and he subsequently found that they had contacted him to arrange for them to say their last goodbyes since they thought he was going to die.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Dr. Dre</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Rapper</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibq2WUp7JutMSao62gXaq9pa3TnmSwoJGpeqmtz6mcp52UYsGweceipGaqkaW9pr6MoqOlppWowG6wxK2YoqSjZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ed-sheehans-fiancee-cherry-seaborn-rocks-huge-diamond-ring.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ed Sheehans Fiancee Cherry Seaborn Rocks Huge Diamond Ring">&larr;
