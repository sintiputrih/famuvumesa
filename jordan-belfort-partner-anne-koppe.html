Jordan is an author, motivational speaker, and former stockbroker.&nbsp;The movie “Wolf Of Wall Street'” is inspired by his life. Anne on her own can be defined as a mother, a supportive partner, and to some extent a businessperson. Read below to learn everything about her in this biographical report.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal Life</h2><p>Anne Koppe has her share of heartbreak, although not known how many times she has been married, we know she is divorced from her ex-husband whom she gave birth to a son. Currently, she is hitched to former Stockbroker mogul Jordan Belfort who is her fiancee too.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Anne Koppe love affair and relationship with Jordan Belfort</h2><p>Anne was not in the picture when Belfort was a major force in Stock Market in late 80’s and 90’s. During the time he was married to <a href=#>Denise Lombardo</a> from 1985 to 1991 and then <a href=#>Nadine Caridi</a> 1991 to 1998.</p><p>The couple, Anne and Jordan Belfort relationship came into existence when Belfort was trying to straighten his life. He had served 22 months jail time relating to penny stock scam (which caused his investors to lose about $200M) and other fraud. After coming out, Belfort turned into a writer and motivational speaker. Along the way, he met Anne in 2008.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Anne-Koppe-and-Jordan-Belfort.jpg><p>In short time the couple began dating, and their relationship flourished. After four years of relationship in 2012&nbsp; Belfort made his girlfriend into finance. The two has not shared much about their engagement details like the ring size or what Belfort has to offer to his better half. However, the important thing is the lovers gave a new name to their well-tuned love life.</p><p>Anne is a supportive partner in many ways&nbsp;to Belfort. She&nbsp;is a helping hand in&nbsp;his&nbsp;business venture also&nbsp;she&nbsp;is supportive by&nbsp;being vocal about&nbsp;him and how he has transformed to be a good citizen.&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>In</a> a letter, she wrote&nbsp;to the judge;</p><p>“Jordan is no longer a criminal, he is an exemplary contributor to the economy. He is a taxpayer and a very hard-working man.”</p><p>Also, Anne has taken to Facebook several times to <a href=# rel=noopener>defend</a> her longtime lover and finance for the hatred and criticism he receives for the mistakes he did in the past. Belfort on the other hand passionately speaks of her during interviews and has shared how she takes care of people he associates with considering his history with a bad company of people. Anne is the lady who prioritizes&nbsp;working in principal and keep that way in her family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Their Children</h2><p>Anne and Belfort have no children in their 10 years of relationship.
