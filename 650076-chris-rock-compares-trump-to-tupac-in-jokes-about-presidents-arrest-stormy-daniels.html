Days ago, Trump made an explosive revelation through his Truth Social app. Trump has been under several investigations, but it's expected that a grand jury could indict him for misappropriating federal funds. Notably, his hush money purportedly paid to former <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">adult film star Stormy Daniels </a>is at the center of the investigation. It was further stated that Michael Cohen arranged for Daniels to be paid $130K to deny she had sex with him. Daniels has also gone on record saying the encounter did occur.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As the indictment looms, Trump revealed he expected to be arrested this week. Meanwhile, Chris Rock used the announcement as a part of his routine while honoring his good friend Adam Sandler. The Billy Madison icon was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in Washington, D.C., and the onlooking crowd included several high-ranking political officials. "Are you guys really gonna arrest Trump?" Rock asked the audience. "Do you know this is only going to make him more popular? It's like arresting Tupac. He's just gonna sell more records. Are you stupid?"</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-trump-calls-for-supporters-to-protest>Trump Calls For Supporters To Protest</h2></span><p>PALM BEACH, FLORIDA - NOVEMBER 15: Former U.S. President Donald Trump arrives on stage during an event at his Mar-a-Lago home on November 15, 2022 in Palm Beach, Florida. Trump announced that he was seeking another term in office and officially launched his 2024 presidential campaign. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Rock additionally quipped, "[Trump's] f*cking a porn star and paid off someone so his wife couldn't find out. That's romantic. We've all been cheated on. Don't you wish that the person that cheated on you paid off somebody so you wouldn't find out?" The jokes arrived when Trump was awaiting news about his potential arrest. He took to Truth Social to call for his MAGA supporters to erupt in protest. It has been compared to his orders given to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">them on January 6</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Trump wrote: "NOW ILLEGAL LEAKS FROM A CORRUPT & HIGHLY POLITICAL MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE, WHICH HAS ALLOWED NEW RECORDS TO BE SET IN VIOLENT CRIME & WHOSE LEADER IS FUNDED BY GEORGE SOROS, INDICATE THAT, WITH NO CRIME BEING ABLE TO BE PROVEN, & BASED ON AN OLD & FULLY DEBUNKED (BY NUMEROUS OTHER PROSECUTORS!)

A grand jury is reportedly convening today to go over evidence, and it looks as if Trump believes there is enough stacked against him.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
