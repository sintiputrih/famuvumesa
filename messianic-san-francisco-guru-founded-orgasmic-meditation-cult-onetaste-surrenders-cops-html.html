She pleaded not guilty today, she’s not guilty.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If convicted, Daedone and&nbsp;Cherwitz each face a maximum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cherwitz, who was the head of sales for OneTaste, was arrested on June 6 in California, while Daedone remained at large and was believed to be overseas prior to turning herself in.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In a statement to DailyMail.com last week, current OneTaste CEO Anjuli Ayer slammed the charges as 'unfounded' and the result of a 'misogynistic, media-driven campaign to tear down a feminine empowerment project and the women who devoted their lives to it.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>OM exploded in popularity following a 2009 New York Times profile of OneTaste, and at one point the company was reportedly raking in $12 million a year from eager clients.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But in 2018, the FBI launched an investigation when ex-customers came forward saying they were left in debt after paying for expensive classes, and former employees said they were told to engage in sexual relations with potential clients to close sales.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now, prosecutors say that between 2004 and 2018, Daedone and Cherwitz deployed a series of abusive and manipulative tactics in order to obtain the labor and services of a group of OneTaste members, including volunteers, contractors, and employees.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The indictment alleges that the duo used tactics designed to render the OneTaste members dependent on the group for their shelter and basic necessities, and to limit members' independence and control.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Members of OM were allegedly kept in 'residential warehouses' where they were forced into sex acts.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>OM involves a woman, naked from the waist down, having her clitoris 'stroked' for exactly 15 minutes by a man, either her own partner or another paying customer.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Prosecutors say the alleged victims were subjected to 'constant surveillance' and isolated from friends and family.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'While employing such tactics, Daedone and Cherwitz demanded absolute commitment to the CEO, including by exalting Daedone's teachings and ideology,' the Justice Department said in a statement.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is claimed that&nbsp;Daedone was a 'messianic' figure at the center of the conspiracy.</p><img id=i-7ca6bafa13bb3db3
