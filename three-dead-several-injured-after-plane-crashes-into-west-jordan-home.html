We couldn’t get him out.”</p><p>Neighbors said they had to tear a fence down to get to the pilot.</p><p>“They were pulling the fence down from the house next to it to extricate the pilot from the plane,” said Jones. “And then we pulled out the female from the back of the plane.”</p><p>Police said the dead include the pilot, a woman, and a 9-month-old baby girl.</p><p>“It was a family, it was a family. The mom who was in the plane, she came stumbling out with her little baby,” said Lyons. “He was limp in her arms.”</p><p>They rushed to help, even taking off the shirts from their backs.</p><p>“And you saw the 2-year-old holding his teddy bear, and he was just burned,” said Lyons.</p><p>Police said one of the surviving children was released from the hospital.</p><p>A 2 year old boy is in stable condition, and the third adult — a woman — is in critical condition, along with the elderly homeowner.</p><p>“Seeing that little boy hold his bear, it’s just very hard, and the mom just lay there and the mom just fought for her babies,” said Lyons.</p><p>The community turned to prayer and gratitude for the actions of those everyday heroes Saturday night.</p><p>“Just happened to be in the right place at the right time I guess,” said Faber.</p><p>Police said notification of next of kin is pending.
