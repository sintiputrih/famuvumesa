She has a daughter named Jagger Jude with her husband Joseph Carretta. In April 2003, the couple exchanged vows, and since then, they have been enjoying a happy marriage. Although the couple’s relationship is characterised by love, this does not mean that they have not experienced their fair share of ups and downs. Following their wedding, Shawn and her husband experienced a miscarriage, which left them both devastated.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Shawn Killinger QVC (@shawnkillingerqvc)</a></p><p>Shawn and Joseph, however, did not lose hope and persisted in their resolve.

Shawn is the mother of two grown stepsons in addition to the fact that they both helped raise Jagger. She enjoys writing and reflecting on her ideas when she isn’t working or spending time with her family. Shawn and I have a lot in common, such as our love of horsey fox hunt decor and British accents. As a result, the TV host keeps accepting both the victories and new difficulties that come her way in life.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c9c5dc8e24ec8d74ae07e882d4c2212b?s=150&d=mp&r=g" height=150 width=150 itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Ayushi S</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><ul><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Best Chick Flicks on HBO Max Right Now: Your Guide to Romantic Movie Nights</span></a></li><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Vanessa Papa The Ultimatum: A Recap of the Drama-Unfolding Reality Show</span></a></li><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Best Indian Shows on Netflix: Exploring Rich and Diverse Cultural Narratives</span></a></li><li>Ayushi S https://dotcomstories.com/author/ayushi-s/ <i class=m-a-icon-doc></i> <a class=molongui-remove-underline href=#><span>Best PG-13 Movies on Netflix: Family-Friendly Entertainment for Various Tastes</span></a></li></ul><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u181e882cd6d8b6e46f22cdc92ca35a6f><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Carolyn Gracie: Whereabouts and Life Beyond QVC</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmicn6mwsLnSraaroZWoe6S7zGigrGWhq7C0edKhmLCmXaC2rbjIp56eql2irrO%2ByJ6bZq%2BYpHqqv4yhnKtlmKrAo63NnWY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./betta-fish-photography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="This Betta Fish Photography Is Anything But Basic">&larr;
