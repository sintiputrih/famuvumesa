He was drafted as a sophomore in college by the New England Patriots, and he spent most of his career with that football team. There he was a frequent target of Tom Brady, universally considered to be the greatest quarterback of all time in the National Football League.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=career-accomplishments><strong>Career Accomplishments</strong></h2><p>During his tenure with the Patriots, Gronkowski won three Super Bowls while also setting numerous records for a tight end. He holds the NFL record for most touchdown catches by a tight end and has played in the Pro Bowl (the NFL’s All-Star Game) five times. He is an NFL tight end who has earned more honors at his position than anyone else in NFL history. When he signed a contract extension with the Patriots in 2012, it was for six additional seasons and $54 million. It was the largest contract ever given to an NFL tight end at that time.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=retirement-and-un-retirement><strong>Retirement and Un-retirement</strong></h2><p>By the year 2020, Rob had racked up many football injuries, as virtually all players who play long enough in the NFL will. This ultimately led to his decision to retire, but in the meantime, he was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where his favorite quarterback Tom Brady had also landed. Speaking about his early retirement, Gronk once said, “Taking a year off was hands down the best decision I made, not just in my career, but also for my health and well-being.”</p><p>With Brady as his throwing mate once again, Gronkowski was persuaded to come out of retirement and play for two more seasons with Tamp Bay. As luck would have it, Tampa won the Super Bowl in that first season after retirement, and Gronk was again in the Winner’s Circle. But he had had enough – so he again retired, and at least for the time being, has remained in the background, pursuing his personal life and his many business interests.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=business-interests><strong>Business interests</strong></h2><p>According to Gronk himself, he has never had to spend any of the money he earned while playing in the National Football League. He’s always been able to live off the endorsement money he regularly receives from companies who admire him as a role model and want him to represent their products and services. He has had contracts representing such varied interests as Tide, T-Mobile, Lyft, Cheerios, Dunkin’ Donuts, Visa, and Nike. In 2012, PLB Sports issued a new <a href=#>cereal</a> called Gronk Flakes, and three years later also released a product named for him called Gronk’s Hot Sauce. In 2016, &nbsp;Monster Energy Company released a new signature flavored beverage with a ‘Gronk’ flavor. All these endorsements were money in the bank for Gronkowski and provide him with all the money he needs to live comfortably.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Rob Gronkowski was born on May 14, 1989, living with his father Gordon and mother Diane in Amherst, NY, and he grew up with four brothers;&nbsp;Dan, Gordie, Chris, and Glenn. All four of his brothers went on to play professional football as well, although none achieved the level of stardom that Rob did. He attended Williamsville North High School, where he stood out on the football team, playing tight end, defensive end, and kickoff specialist. He was a well-rounded athlete who was also on the basketball team and the baseball team.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=moving-to-pennsylvania><strong>Moving to Pennsylvania</strong></h2><p>His family moved to Pennsylvania, where Gronk again became a standout on the Woodland Hills High School football team. His excellence on the football field earned him a spot on the All Western-New York team, a Super-Prep All-American, and he was also recognized as an Associated Press Class 4-A All-State player. After graduating from high school in 2007, Rob was heavily recruited by several colleges, choosing to sign with the University of Arizona.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=nfl-records-owned-by-rob-gronkowski><strong>NFL records owned by Rob Gronkowski</strong></h2><p>During his illustrious NFL career, Rob set quite a few records at his tight end position. In 2010, he became the youngest player in league history to catch three touchdown passes in a single game, and in 2011, he became the first tight end in history to lead the league in touchdown catches. From 2010 through 2012, he was the only tight end to catch at least 10 touchdown passes in consecutive seasons, a feat that has never been equaled. He also holds the record for most catches in Super Bowl history&nbsp;(23), most Super Bowl receiving yards by a tight end (297), most career postseason receiving touchdowns (12), and most career post-season receiving yards (1,163).</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=rob-gronkowskis-personal-life><strong>Rob Gronkowski’s personal life</strong></h2><p>If his professional career&nbsp;has been spent in the public eye, Rob’s personal life has been rather private, and he has not kept the gossip wheels churning out of personal preference. However, he has been involved with model Camille Kostek since 2015, and they tend to avoid the cameras and the headlines. They did appear jointly in a public donation of 16,000 masks to the Foxboro Fire Department, to lend aid to the fight against coronavirus. They also appeared as a couple in a 2020 video by Kygo, entitled I’ll Wait. Rob also appeared in a <a href=#>Katy Perry</a> video, Swish Swish.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=tv-and-films><strong>TV and films</strong></h2><p>He has also appeared in some TV shows and films, notably The Masked Singer, The Clapper, Family Guy, and Entourage. He had a starring role in several WWE episodes and was one of several big names in the WrestleMania 36 television special. In 2020, he also made an appearance on Monday Night Raw. Between NFL salary, endorsements, and show appearances, Rob Gronkowski’s net worth has given him a very comfortable living.</p><h2>Rob Gronkowski FAQs</h2><h3 itemprop=name>What is Rob Gronkowski Net Worth?</h3><p itemprop=text>Rob Gronkowski net worth is currently $45 million USD.</p><h3 itemprop=name>How much money does Rob Gronkowski earn?</h3><p itemprop=text>Rob Gronkowski earns $9 million per year from various sources.</p><h3 itemprop=name>How tall is Rob Gronkowski?</h3><p itemprop=text>Rob Gronkowski is 6 ft 5 in (1.98 m)</p><h3 itemprop=name>How old is Rob Gronkowski?</h3><p itemprop=text>Rob Gronkowski is currently 34 years old.</p><h3 itemprop=name>When is Rob Gronkowski birthday?</h3><p itemprop=text>Rob Gronkowski birthday is on 14th May.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvLsKatZpOkunC%2BzptkoKqfo7iww9KkoGamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./troy-garity-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Troy Garity  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr;
