Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Krizz Kaliko was born Samuel William Christopher Watson. He had vitiligo, a skin ailment that causes white patches of skin on the body because the body doesn’t produce enough melanin.</p><p>Krizz experienced bullying as a result of her weight and vitiligo. At his school, he was frequently bullied by other children who would follow after him, hurl rocks at him, mock him, degrade him, and slam him.</p><p>As a youngster, Krizz was subjected to such severe bullying that he had to spend most of his days walking home from school.</p><p>The American rapper had a solid family background but few pals as a child. They all genuinely cared about him and were always there to support him. His mother taught him how to sing and assisted him in getting ready to participate in a choir, while his father served as his idol.</p><p>Krizz’s main focus was on his sister, who frequently defended herself against bullies with a knife or a gun. Krizz’s supportive family helped him discover his passion for music and his talent for singing. Krizz occasionally got himself into trouble because of his amazing sense of humor.</p><p>Krizz was going through one of the hardest moments of his life when he met Crystal, the love of his life and future wife. Sadly, Krizz lost his father when he was a senior in high school. This sent him down a rabbit hole of misery that never ended and eventually led to bipolar disorder.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style="width:80%;margin:0 auto"><tbody><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Celebrated Name:</th><td style=height:24px>Krizz Kaliko</td></tr><tr class=alt style=height:48px><th style=height:48px>Real Name/Full Name:</th><td style=height:48px>Samuel William Christopher Watson IV</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Gender:</th><td style=height:24px>Male</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Age:</th><td style=height:24px>48 years old</td></tr><tr class=alt style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Birth Date:</th><td style=height:24px>March 7th 1974</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Birth Place:</th><td style=height:24px>Kansas City, Missouri, United States</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Nationality:</th><td style=height:24px>American</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Height:</th><td style=height:24px>1.72 m</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Weight:</th><td style=height:24px>85 kg</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Sexual Orientation:</th><td style=height:24px>Straight</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Marital Status:</th><td style=height:24px>Married</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Wife/Spouse (Name):</th><td style=height:24px>Crystal Watson</td></tr><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Children:</th><td style=height:24px>No</td></tr><tr style=height:48px><th style=height:48px>Dating/Girlfriend<br>(Name):</th><td style=height:48px>N/A</td></tr><tr class=alt style=height:48px><th style=height:48px>Profession:</th><td style=height:48px>American rapper, singer, and songwriter</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr style=height:24px><th style=height:24px>Net Worth in 2022:</th><td style=height:24px>$1.5 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Krizz_Kaliko_Weight_Hair_Color>How tall is Krizz Kaliko?
