In addition, he is the author of several books, including the well-known one “The Man I Never Met.”</strong></p><p>Without a doubt, someone is always responsible for the success of everyone. For Adam’s spouse, Sharri Maio (also known as Sharri Maio Schefter), the same might be stated. “She has challenged me and made me a better husband, father, and reporter,” the man stated.</p><h2><span id=Net_Worth>Net Worth</span></h2><p>Although Sharri’s exact net worth is unknown, her husband Adam is thought to be around $4 million. He primarily earns the most of his wealth from his successful journalism career. In addition, he receives a salary of $1.2 million annually.</p><h2><span id=The_history_of_Adam_Schefter8217s_wife_Sharri_Maio>The history of Adam Schefter’s wife, Sharri Maio</span></h2><p>In Syosset, York, on May 29, 1969, Sharri Brooke Setty gave birth to Sharri Maio. She is Joann Forman Setty’s daughter, married to Charles “Chuck.” She grew up mostly in Syosset, New York, where she lived with her parents and siblings.</p><p>Setty’s nationality is American, and her ethnicity is Caucasian.</p><h2><span id=Sharri_Maio_wed_her_initial_spouse_Maio_Joe>Sharri Maio wed her initial spouse Maio Joe</span></h2><p>In 1993, the ex-couple had their first meeting in the Hamptons. After that, they started dating, and they spent years enjoying each other’s company until getting married in 1998.</p><p>After their son Devon was born in June 2000, the two also became parents for the first time in June 2000. 2018 saw him graduate from North Shore Senior High School.</p><p>The little son is presently enrolled in Adam’s alma school, the University of Michigan, to study economics. In addition, he is interning at Innovation Advisors as an analyst.</p><h2><span id=Her_spouse_perished_in_the_World_Trade_Center_attack_in_2001>Her spouse perished in the World Trade Center attack in 2001.</span></h2><p>Before Joe’s unexpected death on September 11, 2001, the darkest day of terrorism in American history, during the World Trade Center attacks, everything was going great between Sharri Maio and her first husband. He was employed at the North Tower on the 105th floor.</p><p>Approximately three thousand individuals perished in the assault. Joe called his wife twice after the amazing experience. The first time, he told her how much he loved her, and the second time, he told her what was going on.</p><p>“He was surprisingly very calm,” Sharri remarked.</p><p>Adam conducted the best research on Joe when writing The Man I Never Met. Joe “was a golden boy,” he told Newsday. He exuded charisma. Adam was intelligent. He was prosperous. Adam had good looks. He had a nice manner. Adam had sensitivity. He was adored. Adam had respect. To be honest, he was the kind of man you would like your daughter to wed.</p><p>The circumstances that Schefter encountered and his romantic relationship with Sharri are highlighted in the book.</p><h2><span id=Learn_Further_Information_About_Joe_Maio>Learn Further Information About Joe Maio</span></h2><p>In the United States, on December 21, 1967, he was born as Joseph Daniel Maio. He was George and Paula Maio’s son. Joe, a graduate of Boston University, has experience working in Tokyo and London. Later on, he was hired by Cantor Fitzgerald in New York as the director of equities derivatives.</p><h2><span id=Adam_Schefter_and_Sharri_Maio8217s_Love_Story_When_Did_They_First_Meet>Adam Schefter and Sharri Maio’s Love Story: When Did They First Meet?</span></h2><p>In July 2006, Sharri went on her first blind date to Long Island with Adam. Adam remembered how their romance first started, describing it as an instant connection.</p><p>“I think there was instant chemistry because Sharri started wearing her insulin pump, which she was always nervous about wearing, shortly after we started dating.”</p><p>He continued,</p><p>“I believe that she felt sufficiently at ease with me to know that it was the best and correct course of action.”</p><p>At the time, Sharri’s life was too stressful as a widow of 9/11, raising her son Devon on her own after her husband passed away.</p><p>Adam was prepared to take on any problems, and a man who was connected to her had to deal with her darkest past.</p><p>Did Sharri and Adam have children together after their second marriage?<br>In 2007, Sharri and her second husband, Adam, wed after dating for almost a year. Even though they have been married for around 13 years, their love story appears to be stronger than ever.</p><p>They were blessed with a daughter, Dylan, born in October 2008, and a son, Devon.</p><h2><span id=Adam_praised_his_wife8217s_contribution_to_the_family>Adam praised his wife’s contribution to the family.</span></h2><p>Adam, Sharri, and their two kids are the real stars of their family. She is a fantastic homemaker, spouse, mother, caregiver, and baker. Adam uttered,</p><p>Nothing gets done without her. The star of this family is Sharri.</p><p>In addition, the 9/11 widow supports her partner in his career. When they initially met, Schefter was employed at NFL Network, which he described as “a 5 am-to-9 pm job—and then some.” Afterward, Sharri assisted Amam in moving to ESPN. The pundit stated,</p><p>“She has aided in propelling me to my current professional position.”</p><p>Ella, Bailey, and Bennie, their three dogs, are also under her care. Maggie, their puppy, died in March 2020.</p><p>Adam expressed even more gratitude for all of her significant roles in the house.</p><p>She is the head of the household. She ensures that everything goes without a hitch. There wouldn’t be a single dog, two children, or one house without her. No manner is possible. Everything happens because of her.</p><h2><span id=How_Did_Sharri_Maio_Schefter_End_Up_Her_Illnesses>How Did Sharri Maio Schefter End Up? Her Illnesses</span></h2><p>When Sharri was expecting her son, Devon, she was given the diagnosis of gestational diabetes, a disorder that causes elevated blood sugar levels during pregnancy. Similarly, she was diagnosed with adult-onset Type 1 diabetes a year after experiencing her greatest loss—the death of Joe.</p><h2><span id=Adam_Schefter8217s_Former_Romance>Adam Schefter’s Former Romance</span></h2><p>The sportswriter had previously married an unidentified woman, just like his wife. But Adam has never discussed his first marriage. Thus, the specifics of their nuptials and the cause of their divorce remain hidden from the public eye.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Concetta Monti, Chani Natasha, and Peachprc."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4224,"10":2,"15":"Arial"}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":40}{"1":46,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":54}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/concetta-monti/"}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":"https://popularbio.com/chani-natasha/"}{"1":40}{"1":46,"2":"https://popularbio.com/peachprc/"}{"1":54}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Concetta Monti</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Chani Natasha</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Peachprc</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Robert Maxfield | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</a></h3>Robert Edward Maxfield is the actual name of Robert Maxfield.
