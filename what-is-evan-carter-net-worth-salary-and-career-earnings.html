There is no denying that his promising career trajectory sees him with substantial earnings on the horizon.</p><p>So, how much net worth does Carter own in 2023? We will learn about that in this article.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Evan-Carter-Playing-For-The-MLB-Team-Texas-Rangers.jpg><p>Evan Jason Carter thanks his supportive parents, Jason Carter and Elizabeth, for his burgeoning baseball career.</p><p>Jason was the 2nd round (50th overall) pick of the Texas Rangers in the 2020 MLB draft- that year’s top-three picks were <a href=#>Spencer Torkelson</a>, Heston Kjerstad,&nbsp;and Max Meyer.&nbsp;</p><p>He played in the minor league system for three years and got the major league entry in 2023.</p><p>In his debut match, he made his first career walk, stolen base, and hit a single off Paul Blackburn.</p><h2>Evan Carter Net Worth: Salary And Career Earnings</h2><p>As of 2023, Carter, 21, has a net worth of $300k. Most of his earnings stem from his MLB contracts, while part of his income comes through endorsements.</p><p>In November 2019, Evan committed to play college baseball at Duke University.</p><p>So, to keep him from signing with Duke, the Texas Rangers picked him in the 2020 MLB draft and <a href=# rel=noopener>offered him a $1.25 million signing bonus</a> in June 2020.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Carters-Net-Worth-In-2023-Is-300K.jpg><p>However, he didn’t earn all that money at once since he was promoted to the major league in the 2023 fall. The average annual salary in the MLB is $720,000.</p><p>According to Spotrac, the baseball outfielder’s adjusted salary in the 2023 MLB season is $89,033.</p><p>For the season, the Rangers’ highest-earning players are <a href=#>Corey Seager</a> ($35.5 million), <a href=#>Marcus Semien</a> ($26 million), and Martin Perez ($19.65 million).</p><p>On his Instagram, Evan Carter mentions brands such as G-Form, Marucci Sports, and Adidas. Even if the actual figure of his endorsement deal is not out, it does earn him a hefty sum.</p><h2>Family Support On Carter’s Baseball Career</h2><p>The Elizabethton, Tennessee native’s family is his biggest fan, supporter, and mentor.</p><p>His passion for baseball comes partly from his father, Jason, who played at East Tennessee State.</p><p>His mother, Elizabeth’s dedication to his career success, gave another strong reason for him to succeed. For instance, she would drive to Atlanta and rent an Airbnb for a week for her son’s youth baseball career.</p><p>The family had an add-on after Evan’s marriage to his longtime girlfriend-turned-wife, <a href=#>Kaylen Carter</a>. They married on December 17, 2022, after a year of engagement (on December 11, 2021).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MLB-Player-Evan-Carter-With-His-Wife-Kaylen.jpg><p>An alumnus of Elizabethton High School, Evan Carter’s MLB journey began after he became the 2020 MLB draft pick of the Texas Rangers. The Rangers enrolled him through minor league systems.</p><p>In 2021, the left-handed batsman played 32 games for the Low A team Down East, hitting 0.236 with two home runs, 12 RBI, and 12 stolen bases.</p><p>Carter divided his 2022 season between Frisco (Double-A) and Hickory (High-A), with 12 home runs, 73 RBI, 21 doubles, and ten triples from 106 games.</p><p>Having played half of the 2023 season in the minor league, he was promoted to the MLB in August 2023.</p><p>He debuted for the Rangers on September 8, 2023, against Oakland Athletics.
